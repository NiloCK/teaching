                <p>The idea here is to identify some feature(s) of the folded-up house that can be tested against the available
                    answers. Since there are only a few feaures to the house, we can concentrate on them:</p>
                <p>
                    The door is on a wall with a triangular top. This can eliminate house 5.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Turning your head (or the piece of paper) upside-down and imagining the walls folding together, we see that the black dot
                    is to the left of the door when we are looking at the door.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Houses 2 and 3 can be eliminated because the dot isn't where it should be relative to the door. House 4 can be eliminated
                    because the door isn't where it must be relative to the dot.
                </p>
                <p>This leaves <b>house 1</b>.</p>

                    and 2019 will have sums that are too large, because the 7 has been increased while the other digits stayed
                    the same.</p>
                <p>
                    Next, incrementing the tens place by one (2027) we have a sum of 11. To balance out this change, we remove one from the ones
                    place, giving $2026$.

                    Finding the 'lone' digit directly is more difficult than first learning about the repeated digit. Eg, if we guess that the
                    lone digit might be $5$, then we're left with the $4$ repeated digits totaling $43 - 5 = 38$, which is
                    difficult to parse because $4$ doesn't divide $38$ evenly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead, trying to guess the repeated digit will give more information. Maybe it's $5$ - then the sum of these repeated digits
                    is $20$, which means the last digit must be ... $23$.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since $23$ is not a digit, we can tell that the repeated digits must account for more of the sum. Adjusting this guess upward,
                    we find that the repeated digit can only be $9$, and the lone digit is $43 - 4*9 = 43 - 36 = 7$.
