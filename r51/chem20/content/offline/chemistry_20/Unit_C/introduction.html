<h3 class="unitCh3">Unit C Introduction</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this unit you will extend your study of chemical bonding  to gain a theoretical understanding of the properties of solutions. The  concepts presented in these modules provide a solid foundation for the study of  stoichiometry, which is covered in Unit D.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This unit has two modules. The  first module, Properties of Solutions, begins with an introduction to the  qualitative aspects of solution chemistry. You will learn how solutions are  classified and differentiated and why some substances dissolve while others do  not. The second half of the module deals with the quantitative nature of  solutions, primarily focusing on methods of expressing and calculating  concentration. As you work through this module, you will have the opportunity  to see how the concepts you learn apply to something you use every day&mdash;tap  water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second module, Acids and Bases, focuses on a key characteristic of  successful theories: their ability to accurately predict and/or explain  experimental results. If a theory is not able to be used to make accurate  predictions and/or explanations of experimental results, it can be restricted,  revised, or even replaced. You will see that Arrhenius&rsquo;s theory of acids and  bases was unable to explain experimental results in its original form. However,  over time, it has been revised to better predict or explain observations. You  will also be introduced to the quantitative aspects of acid-base chemistry and  related mathematical formulas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together these modules will help you learn how to investigate solutions,  describe their physical and chemical properties, and describe solutions qualitatively  and quantitatively.</p>
<p><br />
  Specifically, you will be able to</p>
<ul>
  <li>describe the qualitative  properties of solutions, acids, and bases<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>communicate the quantitative  properties of solutions, acids, and bases<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>evaluate the success of  scientific theories based on their ability to predict experimental results<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>investigate the chemistry behind  familiar scenarios in everyday life</li>
</ul>
