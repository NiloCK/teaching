<h5><strong>Module Descriptions</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Module 4&mdash;Properties of Solutions</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this module you will explore  the relationship between empirical properties and theoretical ideas, with an  emphasis on qualitative and quantitative analysis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The essential questions that you will look at in this module are</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are some of  your preconceived notions about solution chemistry?</li>
  <li>Have you acquired new knowledge from this module that contradicts       your prior beliefs? </li>
</ul>
  <h6>Module 5&mdash;Acids and Bases</h6>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In this module you will learn  the answers to these questions and explore several aspects of acid-base  chemistry.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In Lesson 2, there are theories,  like the Arrhenius&rsquo;s theory, that attempt to explain and predict the behaviour  of acidic and basic substances when they are dissolved in an aqueous solution.  However, you may have found situations where this theory was not adequate when  explaining and predicting your observations of the behaviour of an acid or  base. In this module you will learn why and in what way Arrhenius's theory  had to be modified to overcome these limitations.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The essential questions that you will look at in this module are</p>
  <ul type="disc">
  <li>Scientific theories are human inventions used to explain events       that occur in nature and predict future results. While learning acid-base       chemistry, you will pay more attention to different theories. What are the       limitations of the different theories you will use?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How do significant digits communicate the appropriate information       about acidic and basic solutions?</li>
</ul>
