<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 4 you  learned that solutions are a special type of mixture&mdash;a homogeneous mixture in  which a solute dissolves in a solvent. Dissolving involves a formation of  intermolecular bonds between the solvent and the solute, leading to observable  energy changes. Solubility plays an important role in the dissolving process as  well, since some compounds do not dissolve to the same extent as others.  Finally, you performed calculations for concentration, dilution, and solution  preparation, giving you some of the basic tools required for laboratory work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the  beginning of this module you were asked, &ldquo;How can solutions be described qualitatively  and quantitatively?&rdquo; You learned that qualitative descriptions involve the  observable properties of a substance, such as colour and smell. Quantitative  descriptions involve numerical measurements, such as mass, volume, and solution  concentration (moles of solute). A complete understanding of chemistry requires  an understanding of both types of relationships. For example, consider the  following statement: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Distilled water is added to a flask of copper(II) sulfate  solution. The blue colour becomes more transparent. </li>
</ul>
<p>This  qualitative observation is not particularly useful since there is no way of  knowing how blue the solution was initially or how blue it was at the end.<br />
  &nbsp; <br />
  Now consider  the following statement:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>50 mL of distilled water is       added to a flask containing 200 mL of 0.1-mol/L copper(II) sulfate       solution. The blue colour becomes more transparent as the concentration       changes to a value of 0.08 mol/L.</li>
</ul>
<p>This revised  statement is far more useful. Chemists who read a description written this way  have enough information to actually recreate the situation and observe the  colours themselves. Successful communication of scientific ideas is highly  rooted in quantitative measurements for precisely this reason&mdash;reproducibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 5 you  learned that the acidic properties of a solution arise from the presence of aqueous  hydronium ions, H<span class="subscript">3</span>O<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq), and that basic properties are  due to the presence of hydroxide ions, <span class="nowrap">OH<sup>&ndash;</sup>(aq).</span> You also learned  that acids and bases may be classified according to different criterion, such  as weak, strong, monoprotic, and polyprotic. The main difference between <em>weak</em> and <em>strong</em> is the degree of ionization, while the difference  between <em>monoprotic</em> and <em>polyprotic</em> is the number of potential  successive reactions with water. You learned that chemicals called indicators  are useful in measuring pH because they experience a colour change within a  very specific range of pH values. In this module you learned to use  mathematical formulas to calculate pH, pOH, and the molar concentrations of  hydronium and hydroxide ions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout this  module you learned about scientific theories that were developed to explain the  behaviour of acids and bases, and you tested these theories and identified  limitations to their ability to either explain or predict the properties of acidic  and basic solutions. This exercise demonstrated the necessity for continuous  testing and revision of scientific theories to ensure that they are supported  by valid experimental results. </p>
