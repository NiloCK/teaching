<h3 class="unitCh3">Module 5&mdash;Acids and Bases</h3>
<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Module Summary </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have now  completed the refrigerator chemistry tour. But before the door is closed, take  a look around and observe some other items in the fridge that weren&rsquo;t discussed  in this module. Do any of these items have the properties of an acid or a base?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think back to  the questions you were asked at the beginning of the module:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Scientific theories are human inventions used to explain events  that occur in nature and predict future results. While learning acid-base  chemistry, you will pay more attention to different theories. What are the  limitations of the different theories you will use?<br />  
      <br />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do significant digits allow appropriate information about  acidic and basic solutions to be communicated?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Arrhenius  theory of acids and bases does not explain observed behaviour of some acids and  bases. The original theory proposed by Arrhenius has since been modified as a  result of knowledge gained through experimentation after it was initially  proposed. In your studies within this unit, you found these theories to be  successful in explaining many, but not all, of the acid-base phenomena you  observed. In Chemistry 30 you will examine other acid-base theories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the  completion of this module, you should be able to solve for one of the following  using appropriate mathematical relationships: pH, [H<span class="subscript">3</span>O<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq)],  pOH or [OH<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq)]. You should also be able to express your answers  using appropriate techniques, such as rounding and significant digits.</p>
