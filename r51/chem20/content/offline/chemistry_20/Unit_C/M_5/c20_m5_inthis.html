<h3 class="unitCh3">Module 5&mdash;Acids and Bases</h3>
<h4>In This Module</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson 1: Properties of Acids and Bases</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acids and bases  had been used for centuries long before any theoretical understanding for their  behaviour. In this lesson you will briefly review concepts related to acids and  bases introduced in Science 10. Once you complete this review, you will learn  about Arrhenius&rsquo;s theory, its limitations in explaining and predicting the  behaviour of acids and bases, and about a new particle called the hydronium  ion.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are the empirical properties of acids and bases?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How are acids and bases named?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Why is the original Arrhenius theory considered to be an  incomplete explanation of the behaviour of acids and bases?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 2: Calculating pH and pOH</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  concentration of acidic or basic particles within a chemical system can be  expressed using a number other than molar concentration. What mathematical  formulas are required to calculate these values? In this lesson you will learn  how to associate pH and pOH with the acidity or basicity of a solution and gain  an understanding of the relative concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions  within a solution.<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>How do you calculate pH, [H<span class="subscript">3</span>O<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq)], pOH, and [OH<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq)]?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 3: Strength of Acids and Bases </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Equal  concentrations of ethanoic acid, commonly called vinegar, and hydrochloric acid  will not have the same pH. Why? How do weak acids and bases differ from strong  acids and bases? How can any differences be explained using the theories that  have been introduced throughout this unit?</p>
<ul>
  <li>How are the empirical properties of weak acids and bases different  from those of strong acids and bases?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>What are polyprotic acids and bases?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 4: Multi-step pH and pOH Calculations </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson  you will apply the formulas introduced in Lesson 3 to help you address a  variety of practical applications, including</p>
<ul>
  <li>preparing a solution with a specific pH </li>
  <li>predicting the pH of a solution using the mass of solute</li>
  <li>predicting the pH of a solution produced by the dilution of  another solution</li>

  <li>How are ionization and dissociation accounted for when calculating  concentration of acidic and basic particles within a solution? <br />
  </li>
  <li>How can a solution&rsquo;s pH be predicted using mass of solute and  solution volume? <br />
  </li>
  <li>Why is the pH of a diluted solution able to be predicted?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 5: Indicators</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>pH can be  estimated using acid-base indicators. Indicators are molecules that have  distinct colours at various pH values. In this lesson you will learn how to use  indicator colour to estimate the pH of a solution. You will also complete a  virtual lab that demonstrates how to use indicators.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What are acid-base indicators? </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How are acid-base indicators used to estimate the pH of a  solution?</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
