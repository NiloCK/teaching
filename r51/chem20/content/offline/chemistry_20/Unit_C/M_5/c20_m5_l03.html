<p>Many people enjoy soft  drinks. Although there are many different brands and flavours of soft drinks,  they all share one common characteristic&mdash;acid. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two acids&mdash;citric acid and  phosphoric acid&mdash;are commonly used in the preparation of soft drinks. As you may  have guessed, these acids are used to influence the taste of the beverage,  offsetting its sweetness. But isn&rsquo;t there a risk to ingesting acids? You may also  wonder how the presence of these acids influences the pH, and other properties,  of soft drinks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson  you will investigate the acids commonly used in foods, and you will compare  them to other acids you have encountered in laboratory experiments.</p>
