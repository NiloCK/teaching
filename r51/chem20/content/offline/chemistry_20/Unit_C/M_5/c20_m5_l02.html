<p>Burritos are a  tasty food that can easily be prepared at home. One of the important parts of a  burrito is the tortilla, which is made from corn. Corn tortillas were prepared  by indigenous North American people and demonstrate one way in which plants native  to North America were used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 1400s  and 1500s, European explorers learned about the agriculture and diet of the  North American peoples. Within a short time, many cultures around the globe  readily incorporated corn-based foods. But there was a problem. Illness seemed  to arise in areas that relied too heavily on corn sustenance, occasionally  reaching epidemic proportions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These health  concerns were a mystery. The indigenous North American people did not display  any ill effects from their corn-based diet. So, why were people getting sick?  As it turns out, there is a very simple explanation, one that requires  knowledge of acid-base chemistry.</p>
