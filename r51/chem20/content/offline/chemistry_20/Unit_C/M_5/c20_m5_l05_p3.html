<p>Read &ldquo;6.3  Acid-Base Indicators&rdquo; on pages 245 to 247 of your textbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As described in  your textbook, the different colours of an indicator correspond to the  different forms that indicator molecules can have. You may have noticed that  the difference between the two forms, HIn and In<sup>&minus;</sup>, is a hydrogen  ion, H<span class="superscript">+</span>. Can you describe a type of reaction that could be  responsible for the loss or gain of an H<span class="superscript">+</span> by a substance? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier in this  module you wrote chemical equations describing reactions of acids and bases.  You may have noticed that during a reaction, acids lose a hydrogen ion and  bases gain a hydrogen ion. Indicators are weak acids and bases that will change  form (and colour) in response to the solution in which they are dissolved. In  basic solutions, litmus will exist in a form represented by the symbol, Lt<span class="superscript">&minus;</span>,  which is blue. In acidic solutions, litmus will exist in a form represented by  the symbol HLt, which is pink. </p>

  solution changes<br />
</div>
<p>So far in this  activity you have seen that compounds within tea and red cabbage can act as an  <strong>acid-base indicator</strong>. Many indicators exist. Click on the following link to view  a table that lists the indicators that are commonly used in laboratories. A  similar version of this table appears in the back cover of your textbook and in the Chemistry Data Booklet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="c20_uC_m5_l05_indicators.pdf" target="_blank">Acid-Base Indicators</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a brief  explanation of each heading that appears in the Acid-Base Indicators table:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Indicator:</strong> Indicators typically  have complicated chemical structures&mdash;knowledge of which is not required for the  majority of chemistry experiments. As such, for simplicity, the common names  are used instead of the chemical names.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Suggested Abbreviation(s):</strong> The complicated  chemical structures are represented using a simple abbreviation. Some  indicators, such as methyl violet, have only one hydrogen and are capable of  only one colour change (yellow to blue). Other indicators, such as thymol blue,  are polyprotic and have multiple colours due to the three possible forms for  this molecule:<br />
      <br />
    H<span class="subscript">2</span>Tb (red), HTb<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span> (yellow) , and Tb<span class="superscript">2&ndash;</span>.  (blue)<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>pH Range:</strong> This lists the pH values where the  colour of the indicator changes. For example the range for methyl red is 4.8 to  6.0. This means in solutions with a pH below 4.8, methyl red will appear red  (HMr); and in solutions with a pH above 6.0, it will appear yellow (Mr<span class="superscript">-</span>)  . The indicator begins to change its form at the first pH value listed in the  range, and all the molecules will have been converted to the other form at the  second pH value.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Colour Change as pH Increases:</strong> The first colour listed  corresponds with the acid form, HIn, of the indicator. The second colour listed  corresponds with the basic form, In<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>K<span class="subscript">a</span>:</strong> This information is not  required in your studies in Chemistry 20. </li>
