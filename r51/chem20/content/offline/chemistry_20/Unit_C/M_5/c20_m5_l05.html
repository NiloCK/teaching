<div class="right2block"><img src="../../images/m5/022_beverages.jpg" alt="A photograph shows two cups of tea, a teapot, a sugar bowl, and a bottle of lemon juice.

<p>The last few weeks have  been really busy, so now it&rsquo;s time to reconnect with your friends. One way to  catch up with friends is to meet and talk while enjoying a cup of tea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many  people like to add things to their tea, but have you ever considered that a  chemical change could result? Lemon juice is a popular thing to add to tea.  Lemon juice contains citric acid and other weak acids. In this module you have  learned that acids can give food a sour taste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cup of tea on the left has a  teaspoon of lemon juice. What changes  do you observe to the tea inside the cup? You may recall from previous science  courses that colour change is one evidence of a chemical reaction. But what  component of tea is involved in the reaction and how is lemon juice involved?  You may also recall other foods that change colour when exposed to acids or  bases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson  you will study the group of molecules called pH indicators. You will examine  how the colour changes that indicators undergo are an example of an acid-base  reaction. You will also discover how these compounds can be used to estimate  the pH of other solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Essential Questions<strong><br />
</strong> </h6>
<ul>
  <li>What are acid-base indicators? </li>
  <li>How are acid-base indicators used to predict the pH of a solution? </li>
</ul>
