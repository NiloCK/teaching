<p>It&rsquo;s a long  weekend in the summer. You and your family decide to enjoy the weather by going on  a camping trip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon returning  home, you find that your refrigerator has malfunctioned and most of the food  inside has spoiled. There is a strong, rancid odour; and it persists even after  all of the food has been removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a brief Internet search, you come across a website that recommends  using baking soda to remove the odour from your fridge. So, you and your family  try this method. A few hours after you leave an open box of baking soda in the  fridge, the intensity of the odour is noticeably less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why can baking  soda reduce the intensity of an odour in a refrigerator? How are principles of  acid-base reactions demonstrated in this and in many other chemical reactions?</p>
