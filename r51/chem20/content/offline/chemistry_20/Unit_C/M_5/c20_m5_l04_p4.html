<h6>Predicting pH of Diluted Solutions </h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="left2block"><img src="../../images/m5/019_test-tubes.jpg" alt="A drawing shows six identical test tubes. The first tube is labeled pH = 1, and the solution within the tube appears dark blue. The remaining tubes are each labeled pH = ? The colour of the solution in each of the remaining tubes is sequentially fainter, with the solution in the sixth tube appearing to have no colour." width="305" height="153" /></span>

  <br />
  In the previous  module you performed a dilution and calculated the resulting concentration of  solute in the diluted solution. In your studies you learned that the algorithm  to calculate the concentration of the dilute solution depends upon the concentration  of solute in the original solution, the volume of original solution taken, and  the final volume of the diluted solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier in this  module you learned that acids react with water to produce hydronium ions. The  concentration of hydronium ions in a solution determines the solution&rsquo;s pH. Can  the concentration of hydronium ions in a solution be affected by dilution? Is  it possible to predict the pH of an acidic solution prepared by the dilution of  another acidic solution using the techniques you have already learned? Do the  same principles apply for basic solutions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  1:</strong> A beaker contains 300 mL of 0.050-mol/L hydrobromic acid. Another beaker  contains <span class="nowrap">700 mL</span> of 0.050-mol/L hydrobromic acid. </p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
  <li>Compare       the pH of the two solutions.<br />
      <br />
    Only the concentration of an acid affects pH. Since each solution has the       same concentration, they will have an identical pH.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="a">
  <li>Calculate the pH of each solution.<br />
      <br />
    Determine the hydronium-ion concentration.<br />
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Hydrobromic acid is a  strong acid; therefore, it reacts completely with water producing hydronium  ions.<br />
  <br />
HBr(aq) + H<span class="subscript">2</span>O(l) &rarr; H<span class="subscript">3</span>O<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq) + Br<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq)<br />
<br />
For each particle of hydrobromic acid dissolved into solution, one hydronium  ion is produced. Therefore, the concentration of hydronium ions will be  0.050 mol/L.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3" type="a">
  <li>Calculate the pH. <br />
    <br />
      <img src="../../images/m5/m5_equations/Eqn039.gif" width="210" height="78" /><br />
      <br />
  </li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" type="a"><li>Suppose 100 mL of pure water is added to the 300-mL solution. Will  the pH increase or decrease?</li>
</ol>
<p>If 100 mL of pure water is added to the 300-mL solution, the  hydronium-ion concentration will decrease because the total volume of solution  has increased. The number of hydronium ions did not increase. Therefore, the  resulting solution, with respect to hydronium ions, will be more dilute and,  thus, have a higher pH.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  2:</strong> 8.0 mL of 0.30-mol/L HCl(aq) is mixed with 12.0 mL of water.</p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
  <li>Calculate       the hydronium-ion concentration.<br />

    Calculate the final concentration of the hydrochloric acid using the       dilution algorithm.</li>

  <li> Calculate        the pH of the resulting solution.<br />

    Hydrochloric       acid is a strong acid. Therefore, the concentration of hydronium ions in       the solution is 0.12 mol/L.<br />

The resulting pH is 1.92.</p>

<ol start="5" type="a">
  <li>Suppose 1.0 mL of the solution from part b. is added to 9 mL of pure  water. Predict the resulting pH without doing any calculations.</li>
</ol>
<p>The pH of this solution will be 2.92. Every time the [H<span class="subscript">3</span>O<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq)]  decreases by a factor of 10, the pH goes up one full unit since the solution  becomes less acidic.</p>

    <p><strong>SC 4.</strong> Only the concentration  has an effect on pH. Therefore, in this particular question, the volume (400  mL) is irrelevant.</p>

    <p>Determine the  hydronium-ion concentration.</p>
