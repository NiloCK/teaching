<p>Baking soda and cream of  tartar are common ingredients for baking. These ingredients are used in baking  because of the way in which they react with other ingredients. The chemical  properties of many of the ingredients found in food contribute to more than  just the taste of the food we eat. Often the chemical properties of ingredients  are due to their acidic or basic nature. In this lesson you will add to your  understanding of acids and bases. </p>

<h6>Essential Questions </h6>
<ul>
  <li>How are ionization and dissociation accounted for when calculating  the concentration of acidic and basic particles within a solution?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How can a solution&rsquo;s pH be predicted using information including  mass of solute and solution volume?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Why is the pH of a diluted solution able to be predicted?</li>
</ul>
