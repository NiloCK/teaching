<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 2 of  this module you prepared a report describing the purpose for some of the  ingredients in your favourite recipes or foods. Cream of tartar is a white  powder that is often used when baking. In this activity you will investigate  the question: What are the chemical properties of cream of tartar?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complete the  steps in the procedure below. Record your data in a form that will enable you  to share it with others. Complete the  questions below.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  <strong>Step 1: </strong>Obtain  three cups or glasses. In the first cup, add 1.25 mL (&frac14; teaspoon) of baking  soda. In the second cup, add 1.25 mL (&frac14; teaspoon) of cream of tartar. In the  third cup, add 1.25 mL (&frac14; teaspoon) of baking soda and 1.25 mL (&frac14; teaspoon) of  cream of tartar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add 5 mL (1 teaspoon)  of water to the cup with the baking soda. Record your observations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Repeat step 2 by adding  5 mL (1 teaspoon) of water to each of the remaining cups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 1</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Baking soda is made from sodium hydrogen carbonate, which is  known to have basic properties. Predict the chemical nature of cream of tartar.  Use your recorded observations to support your prediction.</p>
<p><br />
    <strong>TR 2.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Describe  a series of tests you could perform that will confirm your prediction in  question TR 1. Include the expected results of these tests that will confirm  your prediction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Include a copy  of your observations with your answers to the questions. You may wish to share your observations  and answers with other people. </p>
