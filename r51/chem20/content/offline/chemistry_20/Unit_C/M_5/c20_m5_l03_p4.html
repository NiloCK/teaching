<h6>Strong and Weak Acids</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While acids  generally demonstrate similar properties, there can be noticeable differences.  In the Comparing Two Acids lab, you probably noticed some differences between  the behaviour of ethanoic acid and hydrochloric acid. Possibly, the most noticeable  difference between the two acid solutions was the intensity of their reaction  to magnesium. While magnesium reacts with both acids, the reaction with  hydrochloric acid produces bubbles quickly compared to its reaction with  ethanoic acid. You may have also noticed that hydrochloric acid is more  conductive and has a lower pH compared to ethanoic acid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe these  differences could be due to the hydrochloric acid solution being more  concentrated; but by examining the list of materials in the lab, both solutions  had identical concentrations. So, what could be the difference between these  solutions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The results from diagnostic tests, such as conductivity and pH, along  with the difference in speed of reaction, differentiate acids into two groups&mdash;<strong>strong acids</strong> and <strong>weak acids</strong>. Refer to the following  table. You may need to review the previous lessons or consult your textbook to  refresh your memory about the scientific principles involved with these tests.

<p>* Observations and  interpretation are based on tests of solutions containing equal concentrations  of strong and weak acids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While  completing the Comparing Two Acids lab, you may have developed a hypothesis  relating the differences between strong and weak acids to the extent to which  the acids ionize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read &ldquo;Strong  and Weak Acids&rdquo; on pages 254 and 255 of your textbook. As you read this  section, summarize what you have learned by writing the definitions for a  strong acid and a weak acid. You may wish to compare your summary with the  following points.</p>

    <td width="302" valign="top"><p>Strength refers to extent of the reaction of the acid or    base with water to form hydronium ions, or hydroxide ions, respectively.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Concentration refers to the quantity of acid or base    particles dissolved in solution.&nbsp; It    does not account for how many of these particles actually react with water to    form hydronium ions, or hydroxide ions, respectively.</p></td>
