<p>Many of the  foul odours from spoiled foods are due to acidic compounds. For example,  butyric acid (butanoic acid) is present in rancid butter. Butyric acid can be  detected by humans at concentrations as small as 10 ppm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does baking  soda remove this odour? In the Try This: An Acid-Base Reaction activity at the  beginning of this lesson, you mixed baking soda with vinegar. It was very  obvious that a chemical reaction was occurring based on the observed foaming  and bubbling. When acidic compounds are present in a refrigerator containing an  open box of baking soda, the sodium carbonate reacts with the acid and moisture  contained within the air inside, neutralizing the odour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is baking soda  the best choice for removing odours in a refrigerator? Use the Internet or your  library to research other substances that have the ability to neutralize  odours. Select one of these substances, and write an experimental design that  could be performed to compare the effectiveness of this substance with baking  soda as a deodorizer. Perform the experiment, and write a paragraph detailing  the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Save your  experimental design, all the data collected, and your results in your course  folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may wish to share your work with your classmates or some other people and make revisions  based on their comments.</p>

<p>Baking soda and  vinegar are two products that have potent cleansing properties. You can use the  Internet to find recipes for many cleaners that use non-toxic materials found  in your kitchen. Use the combination of search terms <em>cleaners</em>, <em>non-toxic</em>, and <em>marketplace</em> to locate recipes for &ldquo;green  cleaners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select  two recipes for cleaning solutions that you wish to investigate; then complete  the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <div class="right2block"><img src="../../images/m5/005_toiletries.jpg" alt="A photograph of various cleaning supplies. Shown are a handbroom and dustpan, a scrub brush, rubber gloves, a sponge, and three bottles of different cleaning products. " width="305" height="203" /><br />
    <span class="credit">&copy;  matka wariatka/shutterstock</span></div>
  Shoot a video or create a slide show or illustrations of you making  the solutions. Indicate what type of cleaner you are making, the ingredients  needed, and the steps required to properly mix them together.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Shoot a video or create a slide show or illustrations of you  using each cleaner for its intended purpose. Evaluate the effectiveness of your  cleaner against commercial products that do the same job.</li>
</ul>
<p>Save a copy of your work to your course folder. Your finished  work should include evidence of your experimental design, the data collected, and  your results. You may wish to share your work with your classmates or some other people and make revisions  based on their comments.</p>
