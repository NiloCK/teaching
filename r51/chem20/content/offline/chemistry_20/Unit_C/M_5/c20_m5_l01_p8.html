<h3 class="unitCh3">Module 5&mdash;Acids and Bases </h3>
<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Lesson Summary</h5>
<h6>&nbsp;</h6>
<p>In this  lesson you explored the following essential questions:<strong><br />
</strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li>What are the empirical properties of acids and bases?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How are acids and bases named?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Why is Arrhenius's original theory considered to be an incomplete  explanation of the behaviour of acids and bases?</li>
</ul>
<p>Empirical  properties can be used to distinguish acids and bases from neutral substances.  Taste, feel, pH, reactivity, and conductivity are all useful diagnostic tests  for this purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While acids and  bases can be used in applications without a theoretical understanding of their  behaviour, chemists require a systematic way of dealing with this large class  of substances. Naming rules have been developed to allow for effective  communication regarding acids and bases. It is very important that you learn  how to name acids and bases&mdash;you will encounter them frequently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Arrhenius's  original theory does not successfully predict all experimental results,  scientists were forced to revise, restrict, or replace the theory. The revised  (modified) Arrhenius theory can successfully explain many empirical properties  of acids and bases, but it is unable to actually predict whether a particular  reaction will take place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example,  the modified Arrhenius theory cannot predict whether H<span class="subscript">2</span>PO<span class="subscript">4</span><span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq)  is an acid or a base. Despite the problems associated with the modified  Arrhenius theory, it is still a dramatic improvement over Arrhenius&rsquo;s original  theory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
