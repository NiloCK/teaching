<h3 class="unitCh3">Module 5&mdash;Acids and Bases</h3>
<h4>Module Introduction</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recall  from previous science courses that acids taste sour. The sour &ldquo;kick&rdquo; of many  foods people eat is due to acids&mdash;often listed as ingredients. You may also  recall your teacher cautioning you in the laboratory that acids can damage your  skin. Knowing this, have you ever wondered why some acids can be used in foods?  Does the concentration of an acid influence its properties? Do other factors  influence the observable characteristics of acids? How can two acidic solutions  with equal solute concentrations have different pH values?</p>

  In this module  you will learn the answers to these questions and explore several aspects of  acid-base chemistry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 2,  there are theories, like  Arrhenius&rsquo;s theory, that attempt to explain and  predict the behaviour of acidic and basic substances when they are dissolved in  an aqueous solution. However, you may have found situations where this theory  was not adequate when explaining and predicting your observations of the  behaviour of an acid or base. In this module you will learn why and in what way  the Arrhenius theory had to be modified to overcome these limitations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scientific theories are human inventions used to explain events  that occur in nature and predict future results. While learning acid-base  chemistry, you will pay more attention to different theories. What are the  limitations of the different theories you will use?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How do significant digits communicate the appropriate information about  acidic and basic solutions?</li>
</ul>
