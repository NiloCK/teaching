<h3 class="unitCh3">Module 5&mdash;Acids and Bases</h3>
<h4>Module Introduction</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recall  from previous science courses that acids taste sour. The sour &ldquo;kick&rdquo; of many  foods people eat is due to acids&mdash;often listed as ingredients. You may also  recall your teacher cautioning you in the laboratory that acids can damage your  skin. Knowing this, have you ever wondered why some acids can be used in foods?  Does the concentration of an acid influence its properties? Do other factors  influence the observable characteristics of acids? How can two acidic solutions  with equal solute concentrations have different pH values?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
  <br />
  In this module  you will learn the answers to these questions and explore several aspects of  acid-base chemistry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 2,  there are theories, like  Arrhenius&rsquo;s theory, that attempt to explain and  predict the behaviour of acidic and basic substances when they are dissolved in  an aqueous solution. However, you may have found situations where this theory  was not adequate when explaining and predicting your observations of the  behaviour of an acid or base. In this module you will learn why and in what way  the Arrhenius theory had to be modified to overcome these limitations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scientific theories are human inventions used to explain events  that occur in nature and predict future results. While learning acid-base  chemistry, you will pay more attention to different theories. What are the  limitations of the different theories you will use?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How do significant digits communicate the appropriate information about  acidic and basic solutions?</li>
</ul>

<p>Opening the  door of a refrigerator not only reveals many food options, but it also reveals  a world of chemistry. In Module 4 you encountered some refrigerator chemistry  with the study of gas solubility in soda pop and salt solubility in pickle  juice. There is much more chemistry happening in your fridge than just  solubility!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foods, in particular, can be studied in the context of acid-base  chemistry, since nearly every item in your fridge contains acidic or basic  molecules. An understanding of acid-base chemistry is an essential component of  food science.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this module  you will study the experimental and theoretical foundations of acid-base  chemistry and learn about how some common food items can be used to demonstrate  these principles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<h4>In This Module</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson 1: Properties of Acids and Bases</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acids and bases  had been used for centuries long before any theoretical understanding for their  behaviour. In this lesson you will briefly review concepts related to acids and  bases introduced in Science 10. Once you complete this review, you will learn  about Arrhenius&rsquo;s theory, its limitations in explaining and predicting the  behaviour of acids and bases, and about a new particle called the hydronium  ion.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are the empirical properties of acids and bases?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How are acids and bases named?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Why is the original Arrhenius theory considered to be an  incomplete explanation of the behaviour of acids and bases?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 2: Calculating pH and pOH</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  concentration of acidic or basic particles within a chemical system can be  expressed using a number other than molar concentration. What mathematical  formulas are required to calculate these values? In this lesson you will learn  how to associate pH and pOH with the acidity or basicity of a solution and gain  an understanding of the relative concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions  within a solution.</p>
<ul>
  <li>How do you calculate pH, [H<span class="subscript">3</span>O<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq)], pOH, and [OH<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq)]?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 3: Strength of Acids and Bases </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Equal  concentrations of ethanoic acid, commonly called vinegar, and hydrochloric acid  will not have the same pH. Why? How do weak acids and bases differ from strong  acids and bases? How can any differences be explained using the theories that  have been introduced throughout this unit?</p>
<ul>
  <li>How are the empirical properties of weak acids and bases different  from those of strong acids and bases?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>What are polyprotic acids and bases?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 4: Multi-step pH and pOH Calculations </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson  you will apply the formulas introduced in Lesson 3 to help you address a  variety of practical applications, including</p>
<ul>
  <li>preparing a solution with a specific pH </li>
  <li>predicting the pH of a solution using the mass of solute</li>
  <li>predicting the pH of a solution produced by the dilution of  another solution</li>

  <li>How are ionization and dissociation accounted for when calculating  concentration of acidic and basic particles within a solution? <br />
  </li>
  <li>How can a solution&rsquo;s pH be predicted using mass of solute and  solution volume? <br />
  </li>
  <li>Why is the pH of a diluted solution able to be predicted?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 5: Indicators</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>pH can be  estimated using acid-base indicators. Indicators are molecules that have  distinct colours at various pH values. In this lesson you will learn how to use  indicator colour to estimate the pH of a solution. You will also complete a  virtual lab that demonstrates how to use indicators.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a long  weekend in the summer. You and your family decide to enjoy the weather by going on  a camping trip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon returning  home, you find that your refrigerator has malfunctioned and most of the food  inside has spoiled. There is a strong, rancid odour; and it persists even after  all of the food has been removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a brief Internet search, you come across a website that recommends  using baking soda to remove the odour from your fridge. So, you and your family  try this method. A few hours after you leave an open box of baking soda in the  fridge, the intensity of the odour is noticeably less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why can baking  soda reduce the intensity of an odour in a refrigerator? How are principles of  acid-base reactions demonstrated in this and in many other chemical reactions?</p>

<h6>An Acid-Base Reaction </h6>
<h6>&nbsp;</h6>
<p>What do you  understand about acids and bases? In previous science courses you may have  investigated their properties, but how do they behave when they are combined?  In this activity you will examine the reaction of baking soda (sodium hydrogen  carbonate) with vinegar (an aqueous solution of ethanoic acid). Follow these  steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Write the chemical  formulas, including their states, for solid sodium hydrogen carbonate and  aqueous ethanoic acid.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  <strong>Step 2:</strong> Place 50 mL of  vinegar into a 100-mL beaker or drinking glass.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Step 3:</strong> Add 5 mL (1  teaspoon) of baking soda to the beaker containing the vinegar.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Step 4:</strong> Observe any  changes that occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 1. </strong>A group of Chemistry 20  students suggests that the balanced chemical equation for the reaction between  baking soda and vinegar is</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NaHCO<span class="subscript">3</span>(s)  + CH<span class="subscript">3</span>COOH(aq) &rarr; NaCH<span class="subscript">3</span>COO(aq) + CO<span class="subscript">2</span>(g) + H<span class="subscript">2</span>O(l)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use your  observations to support or argue against the suggested equation. Identify any  additional tests you might want to perform to support your answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="show_btn"><strong>Check your work.</strong></div>
<h6><strong><img src="../icons/try_this.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Try This Answer</strong></h6>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>TR 1. </strong>The proposed chemical  equation is correct. A gas is produced, as indicated by the equation, along  with neutral products. This is consistent with the definition for an acid-base  reaction.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Further tests  may include a litmus test&mdash;to determine whether the products are acidic, basic,  or neutral&mdash;and a limewater test&mdash;to identify whether the gas produced is carbon  dioxide (limewater turns cloudy = carbon dioxide present).</p>

<h6>Acids and Bases&mdash;Review of Basic Concepts </h6>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
  Acids and bases  can be defined using empirical and theoretical definitions.</p>

<p>Empirical  definitions, like those in the table, describe acids and bases in terms of  their behaviour during chemical tests. Empirical definitions only provide one  type of knowledge about substances and may not provide information as to why  such behaviour is observed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turn to pages  248 to 253 of your textbook and read &ldquo;6.4 Explaining Acids and Bases&rdquo; to learn  more about the theories about acids and bases you will use in this module. As  you read this section, make summary notes on the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the difference between dissociation and ionization<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>the particle identified as providing a solution with its acidic  properties by the different theories discussed<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>the particle identified as providing a solution with its basic  properties by the different theories discussed<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>the particles involved during a neutralization reaction<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>how a neutralization reaction can result in &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; products<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p>You may wish to  include, as often as possible, examples of chemical reactions that are helpful  for your summaries and explanations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
You may also wish to review the rules regarding the naming and writing  formulas for acids and bases. These rules appear on pages 34 to 36 in your  textbook.

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Conductivity:</strong> It&rsquo;s useful for  separating out neutral molecular solutions, but it cannot distinguish between  acids, bases, and neutral ionic solutions.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Litmus:</strong> It can be used to  distinguish between acids, bases, and neutral solutions, but it does not give  an exact pH value. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Taste:</strong> Taste may be used to  recognize acids and dissolved salts (such as table salt), but solutions must  never be tasted in the lab for safety reasons.</p>

<p><strong>The Hydronium Ion</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="left3block"><img src="../../images/m5/002_atoms.jpg" alt="A diagram shows a molecule of water reacting with a hydrogen ion. The water molecule is shown as a single red sphere labeled O and two grey spheres each labeled H. Eight dots appear around the red sphere representing its electrons. Six of these dots are red in colour, and two are grey. In the space between each of the grey spheres and the red sphere are a grey and a red dot. Two pairs of red dots appear around the red sphere. These are labeled exposed, lone electron pairs. The single hydrogen ion is depicted as a grey sphere with no dots surrounding it. A series of dotted lines span the region from one of the lone pairs on the water molecule to the hydrogen ion. These dotted lines are labeled electrostatic attraction to negative region of molecule. The product of the reaction is labeled hydronium ion and is a water molecule with an additional grey sphere. The third grey sphere is located nest to one of the lone electron pairs." width="445" height="122" /></div>

<p>You may recall  that the position of lone pairs of electrons around the surface of a water  molecule contributes to its polarity. The tendency of these lone pairs is to  attract positive charges. Free hydrogen ions, which have a positive charge, are  naturally drawn by electrostatic forces toward water molecules, resulting in  the formation of <strong>hydronium ions</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examine the  structure of the hydronium ion shown in the diagram. Note that all of the  hydrogen atoms are covalently bonded to the central oxygen atom. The presence  of the lone pair results in a trigonal pyramidal structure for the hydronium  ion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A combination  of theoretical and experimental data supports the notion of the hydronium ion  as the acidic particle.<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arrhenius&rsquo;s theory was unable to explain the mechanism by which an  acid &ldquo;falls apart&rdquo; (ionizes) to yield the hydrogen ion. The ionization of acids  can be explained as a result of collisions between solutes and water molecules,  in which a hydrogen ion is transferred to the water molecule, bonding to one of  the lone pairs of electrons.</li>

<p>Many of the  foul odours from spoiled foods are due to acidic compounds. For example,  butyric acid (butanoic acid) is present in rancid butter. Butyric acid can be  detected by humans at concentrations as small as 10 ppm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does baking  soda remove this odour? In the Try This: An Acid-Base Reaction activity at the  beginning of this lesson, you mixed baking soda with vinegar. It was very  obvious that a chemical reaction was occurring based on the observed foaming  and bubbling. When acidic compounds are present in a refrigerator containing an  open box of baking soda, the sodium carbonate reacts with the acid and moisture  contained within the air inside, neutralizing the odour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is baking soda  the best choice for removing odours in a refrigerator? Use the Internet or your  library to research other substances that have the ability to neutralize  odours. Select one of these substances, and write an experimental design that  could be performed to compare the effectiveness of this substance with baking  soda as a deodorizer. Perform the experiment, and write a paragraph detailing  the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Save your  experimental design, all the data collected, and your results in your course  folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Lesson Summary</h5>
<h6>&nbsp;</h6>
<p>In this  lesson you explored the following essential questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are the empirical properties of acids and bases?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How are acids and bases named?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Why is Arrhenius's original theory considered to be an incomplete  explanation of the behaviour of acids and bases?</li>
</ul>
<p>Empirical  properties can be used to distinguish acids and bases from neutral substances.  Taste, feel, pH, reactivity, and conductivity are all useful diagnostic tests  for this purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While acids and  bases can be used in applications without a theoretical understanding of their  behaviour, chemists require a systematic way of dealing with this large class  of substances. Naming rules have been developed to allow for effective  communication regarding acids and bases. It is very important that you learn  how to name acids and bases&mdash;you will encounter them frequently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Arrhenius's  original theory does not successfully predict all experimental results,  scientists were forced to revise, restrict, or replace the theory. The revised  (modified) Arrhenius theory can successfully explain many empirical properties  of acids and bases, but it is unable to actually predict whether a particular  reaction will take place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example,  the modified Arrhenius theory cannot predict whether H<span class="subscript">2</span>PO<span class="subscript">4</span><span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq)  is an acid or a base. Despite the problems associated with the modified  Arrhenius theory, it is still a dramatic improvement over Arrhenius&rsquo;s original  theory.</p>

<p>Burritos are a  tasty food that can easily be prepared at home. One of the important parts of a  burrito is the tortilla, which is made from corn. Corn tortillas were prepared  by indigenous North American people and demonstrate one way in which plants native  to North America were used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 1400s  and 1500s, European explorers learned about the agriculture and diet of the  North American peoples. Within a short time, many cultures around the globe  readily incorporated corn-based foods. But there was a problem. Illness seemed  to arise in areas that relied too heavily on corn sustenance, occasionally  reaching epidemic proportions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These health  concerns were a mystery. The indigenous North American people did not display  any ill effects from their corn-based diet. So, why were people getting sick?  As it turns out, there is a very simple explanation, one that requires  knowledge of acid-base chemistry.</p>

<h6>The pH Scale</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In previous  science courses, you may have measured and commented on the pH of solutions,  but did you really know what that measurement meant? You may recall the  following criteria that are often used to classify acidic, basic, and neutral  solutions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If <strong>[H<span class="subscript">3</span>O<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq)] = [OH<span class="superscript">-</span>(aq)]</strong>,  then the solution is <strong>neutral.</strong><br />
  If <strong>[H<span class="subscript">3</span>O<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq)] &gt; [OH<span class="superscript">-</span>(aq)]</strong>,  then the solution is <strong>acidic.</strong><br />
  If <strong>[H<span class="subscript">3</span>O<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq)] &lt; [OH<span class="superscript">-</span>(aq)]</strong>,  then the solution is <strong>basic.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more  about the pH scale and what the values on this scale mean in terms of  hydronium-ion and hydroxide-ion concentrations, read pages 238 and 239 of &ldquo;6.2  pH and pOH Calculations&rdquo; in your textbook.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  Use &ldquo;Figure 3&rdquo; on  page 239 to answer &ldquo;Practice&rdquo; questions 1 to 3. Check your answers with those  given at the back of the textbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Calculating pH </h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read pages 240  to 242 in your textbook. Also read &quot;Precision Rule for pH&quot; and &quot;Certainty&quot; on page 814 in your textbook. Carefully work through the &ldquo;SAMPLE problems&rdquo; and  &ldquo;COMMUNICATION examples&rdquo; presented, as well as the examples below.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>A pH value is  an expression of the hydronium-ion concentration for a solution. Since  hydronium-ion concentrations are often small, the most convenient way to  represent these values is as a negative logarithm. To convert a hydronium-ion  concentration into a pH value, the following algorithm is used:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/m5/m5_equations/Eqn001.gif" width="154" height="33" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To convert a pH  value back into a hydronium-ion concentration, the following algorithm is used:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/m5/m5_equations/Eqn002.gif" width="140" height="33" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier, you  were asked to express values using the appropriate number of significant  digits. The number of digits following the decimal point of a pH value equals  the number of significant digits in the hydronium-ion concentration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Work through  the next four examples. Examples 1 and 2 provide a multimedia activity that  shows how to perform the calculations using a graphing calculator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1 </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A solution has  a hydronium-ion concentration of 2.5 &times; 10<span class="superscript">&minus;9</span> mol/L. Calculate the pH  of this solution.</p>
<p>Since the  hydronium-ion concentration is given, use the formula for pH.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/m5/m5_equations/Eqn003.gif" width="154" height="33" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Substitute the  hydronium-ion concentration into the formula.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this  lesson, you learned that indigenous North American people were able to survive  very well on a corn-based diet, whereas other cultures did not fare so well.  Pellagra is a condition caused by a lack of niacin in the diet. The symptoms of  pellagra include &ldquo;the four D's&rdquo;&mdash;diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death.  Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is critical to cellular metabolism  and DNA repair. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the indigenous North American people prepared their corn  for foods, they soaked and cooked the corn in limewater&mdash;a basic solution that  removes the outer hull of the corn. By removing the hull, the corn could be  ground much more effectively, dramatically improving the availability of  vitamins and minerals, like niacin, within the corn. Since other cultures did  not prepare the corn by soaking it in a basic solution to remove the hull, the  foods they ate that were based on corn lacked the necessary nutrients to  support their health.</p>

<p>The following question was investigated in this  lesson:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How do you calculate pH, [H<span class="subscript">3</span>O<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq)], pOH,  and [OH<span class="superscript">&minus;</span>(aq)]?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>pH or pOH are  logarithmic values that represent the concentration of hydronium ions and  concentration of hydroxide ions, respectively, within solutions. These values  are used because the concentration of these ions is often very small. The  following algorithms can be used to perform calculations involving pH, pOH, and  the concentration of their respective ions in solution: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>pH = &minus;log[H<span class="subscript">3</span>O<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq)]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[H<span class="subscript">3</span>O<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq)] = 10<span class="superscript">&ndash;pH</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p>Many people enjoy soft  drinks. Although there are many different brands and flavours of soft drinks,  they all share one common characteristic&mdash;acid. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two acids&mdash;citric acid and  phosphoric acid&mdash;are commonly used in the preparation of soft drinks. As you may  have guessed, these acids are used to influence the taste of the beverage,  offsetting its sweetness. But isn&rsquo;t there a risk to ingesting acids? You may also  wonder how the presence of these acids influences the pH, and other properties,  of soft drinks.</p>

    <p>* Calculated using average pH</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The pH values  of the two soft drinks are quite similar in that they only differ by 0.2.  Therefore, they have similar acidity in relation to the pH scale. The  concentration of hydronium ions in each soft drink is similar since the values  are of the same order of magnitude (exponent).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>TR 2.</strong> The lemon-flavoured soft drink contains over ten times more acid than the cola.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img src="../../images/m5/m5_equations/Eqn019.gif" width="414" height="38" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>TR 3.</strong> Refer to the table in  the answer to question TR 1. The cola contains the higher hydronium-ion  concentration.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>TR 4.</strong> The soft drink with the higher concentration of acid has a higher pH. This  result is not the expected correlation. A greater concentration of acid should  result in a higher concentration of hydronium ions, formed by the reaction of  the acid with water molecules. A possible explanation is that fewer citric acid  particles react with water to form hydronium ions compared to phosphoric acid  particles. </p>

<h6>Strong and Weak Acids</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While acids  generally demonstrate similar properties, there can be noticeable differences.  In the Comparing Two Acids lab, you probably noticed some differences between  the behaviour of ethanoic acid and hydrochloric acid. Possibly, the most noticeable  difference between the two acid solutions was the intensity of their reaction  to magnesium. While magnesium reacts with both acids, the reaction with  hydrochloric acid produces bubbles quickly compared to its reaction with  ethanoic acid. You may have also noticed that hydrochloric acid is more  conductive and has a lower pH compared to ethanoic acid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe these  differences could be due to the hydrochloric acid solution being more  concentrated; but by examining the list of materials in the lab, both solutions  had identical concentrations. So, what could be the difference between these  solutions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The results from diagnostic tests, such as conductivity and pH, along  with the difference in speed of reaction, differentiate acids into two groups&mdash;<strong>strong acids</strong> and <strong>weak acids</strong>. Refer to the following  table. You may need to review the previous lessons or consult your textbook to  refresh your memory about the scientific principles involved with these tests.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While  completing the Comparing Two Acids lab, you may have developed a hypothesis  relating the differences between strong and weak acids to the extent to which  the acids ionize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read &ldquo;Strong  and Weak Acids&rdquo; on pages 254 and 255 of your textbook. As you read this  section, summarize what you have learned by writing the definitions for a  strong acid and a weak acid. You may wish to compare your summary with the  following points.</p>

      <li><strong>Test 1:</strong> If an acidic solution is tested for conductivity and it is  highly conductive, then it contains a high concentration of ions [H3O+(aq)  and anions] and is a strong acid. If the conductivity is low, then it contains  few ions, and is a weak acid.<strong><br />
            <br />
            <strong>Test 2:</strong></strong> If an acidic  solution is tested for pH and it has a low pH, then it contains a high  concentration of hydronium ions and is a strong acid. If the pH is high, the  solution contains few hydronium ions and is a weak acid.<br />

<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Lesson Summary </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following critical questions were discussed  in this lesson:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How are the empirical properties of weak acids and bases different  from those of strong acids and bases?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>What are polyprotic acids and bases?<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Acids and bases  have varying properties depending on the degree of ionization or dissociation.  A strong acid, such as HCl(aq), and a weak acid, such as CH<span class="subscript">3</span>COOH(aq),  can have different pH values even though the concentration of each acid is the  same. Other empirical properties&mdash;such as conductivity, pH, and rate of reaction&mdash;are  more pronounced when comparing solutions containing strong acids than for weak  acid solutions with identical solute concentration. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Polyprotic  acids and bases may undergo successive reactions with water to produce  hydronium ions or hydroxide ions. In the majority of cases, only the first  reaction of a polyprotic substance contributes significantly to the overall pH  of a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson Glossary </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>monoprotic acid:</strong> an acid that possesses only  one ionizable proton and can react only once with water to produce hydronium  ions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>monoprotic base:</strong> a base that can react only  once with water to produce hydroxide ions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>polyprotic acid:</strong> an acid with more than one  acidic hydrogen available to react with water to produce hydronium ions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>polyprotic base:</strong> a base that can react more  than once with water to form hydroxide ions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>strong acid:</strong> a substance  that forms a solution with strong acidic properties</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strong acids react completely (&gt;99%) with water to form hydronium  ions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>strong base:</strong> a substance  that forms a solution with strong basic properties</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strong bases are ionic hydroxides that dissociate completely (&gt;99%)  to release hydroxide ions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>weak acid:</strong> a substance  that forms a solution with weak acidic properties</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Weak acids react incompletely with water (&lt;50%) to form relatively  few hydronium ions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>weak base:</strong> a substance  that forms a solution with weak basic properties</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Baking soda and cream of  tartar are common ingredients for baking. These ingredients are used in baking  because of the way in which they react with other ingredients. The chemical  properties of many of the ingredients found in food contribute to more than  just the taste of the food we eat. Often the chemical properties of ingredients  are due to their acidic or basic nature. In this lesson you will add to your  understanding of acids and bases. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Up to now you  have investigated many of the properties of acidic and basic solutions. In  Module 4 you examined procedures for preparing solutions. What must you  consider when preparing acidic or basic solutions of a desired pH or concentration?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Calculating the pH of a Stock Solution</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="left2block">

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
  <br />
  The ability to  prepare a solution with a specific pH is a necessary skill for laboratory work.  Work through the following examples to see how the pH of an acidic or basic  solution can be predicted using information including the identity and mass of  the solute, as well as total solution volume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may wish to  refer to information about the preparation and dilution of solutions on pages  803 and 804 in your textbook. You may also want to review information on  significant digits and precision on page 814 of your textbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  1: </strong>2.56  g of hydrogen chloride gas, HCl(g), is dissolved in water to make a 300-mL solution.  Calculate the pH of the solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>List  the knowns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="left1block"><em>m</em> = 2.56 g</div>
<br />
<br />
<div class="left2block"><img src="../../images/m5/m5_equations/Eqn020.gif" width="266" height="72" /></div>
<div class="left2block"><img src="../../images/m5/m5_equations/Eqn021.gif" width="188" height="60" /></div>
<p><strong><br />
  Step 2:</strong> Calculate the number of  moles of HCl(g).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/m5/m5_equations/Eqn022.gif" width="189" height="94" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Calculate  the concentration of HCl(aq).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/m5/m5_equations/Eqn023.gif" width="205" height="92" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Determine the  concentration of H<span class="subscript">3</span>O<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HCl(aq) + H<span class="subscript">2</span>O(l)  &rarr; H<span class="subscript">3</span>O<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq) + Cl<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HCl(aq) is a  strong acid. Strong acids ionize completely (reacts &gt;99% with water). Therefore,  the hydronium-ion concentration will be the same as that of HCl(aq).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Calculate  the pH.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/m5/m5_equations/Eqn024.gif" width="262" height="80" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pH of the  solution is 0.631.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  2:</strong> 330 mg of solid barium hydroxide, Ba(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span>(s), is dissolved in water  to make a 600-mL solution. Calculate the pOH of the solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>List  the knowns and unknowns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/m5/m5_equations/Eqn025.gif" width="190" height="68" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/m5/m5_equations/Eqn026.gif" width="445" height="80" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/m5/m5_equations/Eqn027.gif" width="188" height="60" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Calculate  the number of moles of Ba(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span>(s).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/m5/m5_equations/Eqn028.gif" width="189" height="94" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Calculate the  concentration of Ba(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span>(aq).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/m5/m5_equations/Eqn029.gif" width="205" height="92" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Calculate the  hydroxide-ion concentration [OH<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq)].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ba(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span>(aq)  &rarr; Ba<span class="superscript">2+</span>(aq) + 2 OH<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ba(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span>(aq)  dissociates completely in water, producing two moles of hydroxide ions for each  mole of Ba(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span> that dissolves. Therefore, the hydroxide-ion  concentration will be double that of Ba(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span>(aq).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/m5/m5_equations/Eqn030.gif" width="342" height="73" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Calculate  the pOH.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/m5/m5_equations/Eqn031.gif" width="258" height="78" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pOH of the  solution is 2.192.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  3:</strong> Calculate the mass of strontium hydroxide, Sr(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span>(aq), required to  make a 320-mL solution with a pOH of 4.75.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Calculate the  hydroxide-ion concentration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/m5/m5_equations/Eqn035.gif" width="289" height="82" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Calculate the  concentration of strontium hydroxide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sr(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span>(aq)  &rarr; Sr<span class="superscript">2+</span>(aq) + 2 OH<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sr(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span>(aq)  dissociates, producing two hydroxide ions for each particle of Sr(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span>  that dissolves. Therefore, the concentration of Sr(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span>(aq) will be  half that of OH<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>c</em><sub>Sr(OH)2</sub> = 1.77827941 x 10<sup>-5</sup> mol/L </p>

<h6>Predicting pH of Diluted Solutions </h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="left2block"><img src="../../images/m5/019_test-tubes.jpg" alt="A drawing shows six identical test tubes. The first tube is labeled pH = 1, and the solution within the tube appears dark blue. The remaining tubes are each labeled pH = ? The colour of the solution in each of the remaining tubes is sequentially fainter, with the solution in the sixth tube appearing to have no colour." width="305" height="153" /></span>
<p><br />
  <br />
  In the previous  module you performed a dilution and calculated the resulting concentration of  solute in the diluted solution. In your studies you learned that the algorithm  to calculate the concentration of the dilute solution depends upon the concentration  of solute in the original solution, the volume of original solution taken, and  the final volume of the diluted solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier in this  module you learned that acids react with water to produce hydronium ions. The  concentration of hydronium ions in a solution determines the solution&rsquo;s pH. Can  the concentration of hydronium ions in a solution be affected by dilution? Is  it possible to predict the pH of an acidic solution prepared by the dilution of  another acidic solution using the techniques you have already learned? Do the  same principles apply for basic solutions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  1:</strong> A beaker contains 300 mL of 0.050-mol/L hydrobromic acid. Another beaker  contains <span class="nowrap">700 mL</span> of 0.050-mol/L hydrobromic acid. </p>
<ol start="1" type="a">
  <li>Compare       the pH of the two solutions.<br />
      <br />
    Only the concentration of an acid affects pH. Since each solution has the       same concentration, they will have an identical pH.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="a">
  <li>Calculate the pH of each solution.<br />
      <br />
    Determine the hydronium-ion concentration.<br />
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Hydrobromic acid is a  strong acid; therefore, it reacts completely with water producing hydronium  ions.<br />
  <br />
HBr(aq) + H<span class="subscript">2</span>O(l) &rarr; H<span class="subscript">3</span>O<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq) + Br<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq)<br />
<br />
For each particle of hydrobromic acid dissolved into solution, one hydronium  ion is produced. Therefore, the concentration of hydronium ions will be  0.050 mol/L.</p>

<ol start="4" type="a"><li>Suppose 100 mL of pure water is added to the 300-mL solution. Will  the pH increase or decrease?</li>
</ol>
<p>If 100 mL of pure water is added to the 300-mL solution, the  hydronium-ion concentration will decrease because the total volume of solution  has increased. The number of hydronium ions did not increase. Therefore, the  resulting solution, with respect to hydronium ions, will be more dilute and,  thus, have a higher pH.</p>

<p>In situations  where concentrated stock solutions of acids and bases are available, dilution  of a sample of the stock solution is an alternative. When a stock solution is  not available, appropriate quantities of solutes (as solids or gases) must be  dissolved. When preparing acidic and basic solutions, you should be very aware  of safety concerns and use appropriate techniques for handling these  substances.</p>

<p>The last few weeks have  been really busy, so now it&rsquo;s time to reconnect with your friends. One way to  catch up with friends is to meet and talk while enjoying a cup of tea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many  people like to add things to their tea, but have you ever considered that a  chemical change could result? Lemon juice is a popular thing to add to tea.  Lemon juice contains citric acid and other weak acids. In this module you have  learned that acids can give food a sour taste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cup of tea on the left has a  teaspoon of lemon juice. What changes  do you observe to the tea inside the cup? You may recall from previous science  courses that colour change is one evidence of a chemical reaction. But what  component of tea is involved in the reaction and how is lemon juice involved?  You may also recall other foods that change colour when exposed to acids or  bases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson  you will study the group of molecules called pH indicators. You will examine  how the colour changes that indicators undergo are an example of an acid-base  reaction. You will also discover how these compounds can be used to estimate  the pH of other solutions.</p>

<p>Red cabbage is  another food that can change colour depending upon pH. Some of the compounds  within the leaves of red cabbage are pH indicators. Follow the procedure below  to investigate some of the colours that can be produced by the juice from red  cabbage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What effect do  different substances have on the colour of red cabbage juice?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Procedure</strong><strong><br />
  </strong><br />
  <strong>Step 1: </strong>Place 2 cups of  finely chopped red cabbage in a bowl.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Step 2: </strong>Pour boiling  water into the bowl, using just enough to cover the red cabbage.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Step 3: </strong>After 20  minutes, drain the liquid from the bowl into a glass and set the cabbage aside.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Step 4: </strong>On a white  plate, place three separate drops of red cabbage juice.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Step 5: </strong>Add one drop of  lemon juice or vinegar to the first drop of red cabbage juice.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Step 6: </strong>Add one drop of  water to the second drop of red cabbage juice.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Step 7: </strong>Add a pinch of  baking soda to the third drop of red cabbage juice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Observations  and Analysis</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 1.</strong> Record your  observations in a suitable data table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TR 2.</strong> Explain how the colour  changes in red cabbage could not be explained as an effect of dilution of the  red cabbage juice.<br />

You may have noticed that during a reaction, acids lose a hydrogen ion and  bases gain a hydrogen ion. Indicators are weak acids and bases that will change  form (and colour) in response to the solution in which they are dissolved. In  basic solutions, litmus will exist in a form represented by the symbol, Lt<span class="superscript">&minus;</span>,  which is blue. In acidic solutions, litmus will exist in a form represented by  the symbol HLt, which is pink. </p>

</div>
<p>So far in this  activity you have seen that compounds within tea and red cabbage can act as an  <strong>acid-base indicator</strong>. Many indicators exist. Click on the  link in Module 5 Lesson 5 Page 3 on your DVD to view  a table that lists the indicators that are commonly used in laboratories. A  similar version of this table appears in the back cover of your textbook and in the Chemistry Data Booklet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a brief  explanation of each heading that appears in the Acid-Base Indicators table:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Indicator:</strong> Indicators typically  have complicated chemical structures&mdash;knowledge of which is not required for the  majority of chemistry experiments. As such, for simplicity, the common names  are used instead of the chemical names.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Suggested Abbreviation(s):</strong> The complicated  chemical structures are represented using a simple abbreviation. Some  indicators, such as methyl violet, have only one hydrogen and are capable of  only one colour change (yellow to blue). Other indicators, such as thymol blue,  are polyprotic and have multiple colours due to the three possible forms for  this molecule:<br />
      <br />
    H<span class="subscript">2</span>Tb (red), HTb<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span> (yellow) , and Tb<span class="superscript">2&ndash;</span>.  (blue)<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>pH Range:</strong> This lists the pH values where the  colour of the indicator changes. For example the range for methyl red is 4.8 to  6.0. This means in solutions with a pH below 4.8, methyl red will appear red  (HMr); and in solutions with a pH above 6.0, it will appear yellow (Mr<span class="superscript">-</span>)  . The indicator begins to change its form at the first pH value listed in the  range, and all the molecules will have been converted to the other form at the  second pH value.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>Colour Change as pH Increases:</strong> The first colour listed  corresponds with the acid form, HIn, of the indicator. The second colour listed  corresponds with the basic form, In<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>K<span class="subscript">a</span>:</strong> This information is not  required in your studies in Chemistry 20. </li>

<h6>Estimating the pH of Solutions Using  Indicators </h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicators can  be used as an inexpensive method to estimate the pH of a solution. You may have  noticed as you completed the previous Self-Check questions that a single  indicator only provides limited information about pH. When estimating pH, more  than one indicator is used. Work through the following example to see how  indicators are used to estimate the pH of a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A  solution is tested with three indicators. The results are summarized in the  following table. Estimate the pH of this solution.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this  lesson you explored the following essential questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are acid-base indicators? </li>
  <li>How are acid-base indicators used to predict the pH of a solution? <br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Acid-base  indicators are weak acids and bases that can have multiple forms, and each form  is associated with a colour. The colour change of one or more indicators can be  used to estimate the pH of a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the  beginning of the lesson you made a red cabbage indicator solution that was  tested with vinegar and baking soda. When mixed with the vinegar, the solution  turned red; when mixed with baking soda, the solution turned a blue-green. The  loss of a hydrogen ion by the indicator to the basic hydrogen carbonate ion is  responsible for the colour change you observed.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have now  completed the refrigerator chemistry tour. But before the door is closed, take  a look around and observe some other items in the fridge that weren&rsquo;t discussed  in this module. Do any of these items have the properties of an acid or a base?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think back to  the questions you were asked at the beginning of the module:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Scientific theories are human inventions used to explain events  that occur in nature and predict future results. While learning acid-base  chemistry, you will pay more attention to different theories. What are the  limitations of the different theories you will use?<br />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do significant digits allow appropriate information about  acidic and basic solutions to be communicated?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Arrhenius  theory of acids and bases does not explain observed behaviour of some acids and  bases. The original theory proposed by Arrhenius has since been modified as a  result of knowledge gained through experimentation after it was initially  proposed. In your studies within this unit, you found these theories to be  successful in explaining many, but not all, of the acid-base phenomena you  observed. In Chemistry 30 you will examine other acid-base theories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the  completion of this module, you should be able to solve for one of the following  using appropriate mathematical relationships: pH, [H<span class="subscript">3</span>O<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq)],  pOH or [OHN<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq)]. You should also be able to express your answers  using appropriate techniques, such as rounding and significant digits.</p>

<h3 class="unitCh3">Unit C Conclusion</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 4 you  learned that solutions are a special type of mixture&mdash;a homogeneous mixture in  which a solute dissolves in a solvent. Dissolving involves a formation of  intermolecular bonds between the solvent and the solute, leading to observable  energy changes. Solubility plays an important role in the dissolving process as  well, since some compounds do not dissolve to the same extent as others.  Finally, you performed calculations for concentration, dilution, and solution  preparation, giving you some of the basic tools required for laboratory work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the  beginning of this module you were asked, &ldquo;How can solutions be described qualitatively  and quantitatively?&rdquo; You learned that qualitative descriptions involve the  observable properties of a substance, such as colour and smell. Quantitative  descriptions involve numerical measurements, such as mass, volume, and solution  concentration (moles of solute). A complete understanding of chemistry requires  an understanding of both types of relationships. For example, consider the  following statement: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Distilled water is added to a flask of copper(II) sulfate  solution. The blue colour becomes more transparent. </li>
</ul>
<p>This  qualitative observation is not particularly useful since there is no way of  knowing how blue the solution was initially or how blue it was at the end.<br />
  &nbsp; <br />
  Now consider  the following statement:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>50 mL of distilled water is       added to a flask containing 200 mL of 0.1-mol/L copper(II) sulfate       solution. The blue colour becomes more transparent as the concentration       changes to a value of 0.08 mol/L.</li>
</ul>
<p>This revised  statement is far more useful. Chemists who read a description written this way  have enough information to actually recreate the situation and observe the  colours themselves. Successful communication of scientific ideas is highly  rooted in quantitative measurements for precisely this reason&mdash;reproducibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 5 you  learned that the acidic properties of a solution arise from the presence of aqueous  hydronium ions, H<span class="subscript">3</span>O<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq), and that basic properties are  due to the presence of hydroxide ions, <span class="nowrap">OH<sup>&ndash;</sup>(aq).</span> You also learned  that acids and bases may be classified according to different criterion, such  as weak, strong, monoprotic, and polyprotic. The main difference between <em>weak</em> and <em>strong</em> is the degree of ionization, while the difference  between <em>monoprotic</em> and <em>polyprotic</em> is the number of potential  successive reactions with water. You learned that chemicals called indicators  are useful in measuring pH because they experience a colour change within a  very specific range of pH values. In this module you learned to use  mathematical formulas to calculate pH, pOH, and the molar concentrations of  hydronium and hydroxide ions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout this  module you learned about scientific theories that were developed to explain the  behaviour of acids and bases, and you tested these theories and identified  limitations to their ability to either explain or predict the properties of acidic  and basic solutions. This exercise demonstrated the necessity for continuous  testing and revision of scientific theories to ensure that they are supported  by valid experimental results. </p>
