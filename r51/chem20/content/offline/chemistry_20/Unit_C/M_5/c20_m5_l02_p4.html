<p>At the beginning of this  lesson, you learned that indigenous North American people were able to survive  very well on a corn-based diet, whereas other cultures did not fare so well.  Pellagra is a condition caused by a lack of niacin in the diet. The symptoms of  pellagra include &ldquo;the four D's&rdquo;&mdash;diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death.  Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is critical to cellular metabolism  and DNA repair. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the indigenous North American people prepared their corn  for foods, they soaked and cooked the corn in limewater&mdash;a basic solution that  removes the outer hull of the corn. By removing the hull, the corn could be  ground much more effectively, dramatically improving the availability of  vitamins and minerals, like niacin, within the corn. Since other cultures did  not prepare the corn by soaking it in a basic solution to remove the hull, the  foods they ate that were based on corn lacked the necessary nutrients to  support their health.</p>

<h6><strong>K</strong><strong>itchen Chemistry &mdash; Using  Acids and Bases in Cooking</strong></h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of the  basic solution, limewater, to prepare corn is one example of how acids and  bases can be used in the preparation of foods. How are acids or bases used in  the preparation of the foods you consume?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find a copy of  your favourite recipe, or read the label of something you have eaten recently.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Review the list  of ingredients; then do the following:<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Identify at least one acidic or basic substance in the list of  ingredients.<br />
        <br />
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write the common name, IUPAC name, and the chemical formula for  this substance.<br />
        <br />
      </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using a relevant chemical reaction, explain why this substance is  used and why the acidic or basic properties of this substance are necessary.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
