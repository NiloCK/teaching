<h3 class="unitCh3">Module 5&mdash;Acids and Bases </h3>
<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Lesson Summary </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following critical questions were discussed  in this lesson:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How are the empirical properties of weak acids and bases different  from those of strong acids and bases?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>What are polyprotic acids and bases?<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Acids and bases  have varying properties depending on the degree of ionization or dissociation.  A strong acid, such as HCl(aq), and a weak acid, such as CH<span class="subscript">3</span>COOH(aq),  can have different pH values even though the concentration of each acid is the  same. Other empirical properties&mdash;such as conductivity, pH, and rate of reaction&mdash;are  more pronounced when comparing solutions containing strong acids than for weak  acid solutions with identical solute concentration. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Polyprotic  acids and bases may undergo successive reactions with water to produce  hydronium ions or hydroxide ions. In the majority of cases, only the first  reaction of a polyprotic substance contributes significantly to the overall pH  of a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson Glossary </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>monoprotic acid:</strong> an acid that possesses only  one ionizable proton and can react only once with water to produce hydronium  ions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>monoprotic base:</strong> a base that can react only  once with water to produce hydroxide ions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>polyprotic acid:</strong> an acid with more than one  acidic hydrogen available to react with water to produce hydronium ions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>polyprotic base:</strong> a base that can react more  than once with water to form hydroxide ions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>strong acid:</strong> a substance  that forms a solution with strong acidic properties</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strong acids react completely (&gt;99%) with water to form hydronium  ions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>strong base:</strong> a substance  that forms a solution with strong basic properties</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strong bases are ionic hydroxides that dissociate completely (&gt;99%)  to release hydroxide ions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>weak acid:</strong> a substance  that forms a solution with weak acidic properties</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Weak acids react incompletely with water (&lt;50%) to form relatively  few hydronium ions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>weak base:</strong> a substance  that forms a solution with weak basic properties</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Weak bases react partially with water (&lt;50%) to produce relatively  few hydroxide ions.</div>
