<p>Now that you  have considered where your drinking water comes from, how do you know if it is  really safe to drink? Does it come from a well or a reservoir? How is it  treated before it gets to your home? Who is accountable if something goes wrong  with your tap water? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Various government agencies set safety standards that water treatment  plants must adhere to. Since it is nearly impossible to remove all dissolved  substances from a solution, maximum allowable concentrations are in place to  protect those who drink the water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson  you will learn how concentration can be expressed using a variety of units. You  will then use this knowledge to gain a better understanding of the chemistry  associated with water quality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Essential Question</h6>
<ul>
  <li>How can the concentration of solute in a solution be expressed?</li>
