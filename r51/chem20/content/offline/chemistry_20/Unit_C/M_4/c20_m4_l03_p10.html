<h3 class="unitCh3">Module 4&mdash;Properties of Solutions</h3>
<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Lesson Summary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In this lesson you explored the following essential  questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>What are saturated solutions?</li>
  <li>How can you predict the solubility of a substance in water?</li>
  <li>How is dynamic equilibrium involved when studying saturated  solutions?</li>
</ul>
<p>In this lesson  you learned that solubility is an important aspect of solution chemistry. The solubility  of a substance is directly linked to the temperature of the solution, and in  the case of gases, external pressure can be a major solubility factor as well.  Solubility rules can be used to successfully predict the states of elements and  compounds in water. Finally, you learned about dynamic equilibrium, a  theoretical explanation of what is happening in a saturated solution at the  molecular level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first three  lessons of this unit focused exclusively on qualitative aspects of solution  chemistry. In Lessons 4 and 5, you will investigate the quantitative aspects of  solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson Glossary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dynamic equilibrium:</strong> the idea that there is a  balance between two opposing processes (forward and reverse) occurring at the  same rate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>immiscible:</strong> a term used to describe  liquids that do not dissolve in each other</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>saturated solution:</strong> a solution that contains  the maximum quantity of solute for a specified temperature; in which no more  solute will dissolve at a specified temperature; at maximum solute concentration</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>solubility:</strong> the concentration of a  saturated solution at a specified temperature</p>
