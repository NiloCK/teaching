<p>Now that you  have an understanding of the regulations protecting your drinking water from  harmful levels of contaminants, it is time to consider how contaminants affect  the rest of the water system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The water in  rivers and lakes is a necessity of life for many organisms, including those at  the bottom of the food chain. The term <em>plankton</em> refers to marine and freshwater organisms that live in water and serve as food  for larger animals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If plankton live in water contaminated with mercury, plankton will  accumulate the toxin over time. Fish consume a large amount of plankton and, in  doing so, accumulate the mercury stored in the plankton. This process continues  all the way up the food chain and presents a significant health concern for  higher-order mammals, including humans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process  described here is called biomagnification, and it is a serious environmental  concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Canada&rsquo;s  North, the traditional Inuit way of life is threatened because the food supply contains  dangerous levels of mercury. In this lesson you will learn how some of the  products in your home pollute the water supply and contribute to  biomagnification.</p>
