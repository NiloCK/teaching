<h6>Dynamic Equilibrium</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the  beginning of this lesson you completed a Try This exercise where you made  observations and wrote explanations about what was occurring within a saturated  solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right1blockC">
  <p><strong>dynamic equilibrium</strong>: the idea that there is a  balance between two opposing processes (forward and reverse) occurring at the  same rate</p>
</div>
<p>When the  solution was cooled, you observed that salt crystals were seen on the bottom of  the beaker. While it may appear the salt crystals are no longer dissolving,  they actually are. The amount of solid appears to remain constant because even  though some of the solid is dissolving, an equal amount of solid is crystallizing  out of the solution. This process is called <strong>dynamic equilibrium</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read the  section &ldquo;Explaining Saturated Solutions&rdquo; on pages 224 to 226 in your textbook. Pay  close attention to the description of the experimental evidence that was used  to test the theory of dynamic equilibrium described on pages 225 and 226.</p>
<h6>&nbsp;</h6>
<p>How does the figure below demonstrate the dynamic equilibrium in the  saturated solution of salt water you observed earlier in this lesson?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="left2block"><img src="../../images/m4/022_dynamic_equilibrium.jpg" alt="A diagram shows an ionic crystal as alternating green and orange spheres arranged in three dimensions. The green spheres are labeled with a minus sign. The orange spheres are labeled with a plus sign. In the upper left corner an orange sphere is shown leaving the crystal. In the upper right corner a green sphere is shown leaving the crystal. In the bottom right corner an orange sphere is shown joining the crystal. In the bottom left corner a green sphere is shown joining the crystal." width="250" height="220" /></div>
<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the dynamic equilibrium  involving a salt crystal in a saturated solution, there is still dissociating,  but the ions that leave are immediately replaced by other ions that enter the  solid from the solution. This process is similar to having a party for 20  people&mdash;if two new guests arrive and two people leave, the total number of  people present at the party remains the same. </p>

<p><strong>SC 11.</strong> State two conditions  required for a solution to be in dynamic equilibrium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 12.</strong> While salt is being  poured into a beaker that initially contains distilled water, would the system  be in a state of dynamic equilibrium?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 13.</strong> Explain what is  happening to a salt crystal in a dynamic equilibrium system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>SC 14.</strong> Describe an experimental technique to test for dynamic equilibrium in a  saturated solution of strontium chloride.

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SC 11.</strong> Two opposing processes  must be occurring at exactly the same rate. The solution must be in a closed  system (the volume of water is constant, the amount of solute is constant, the  temperature is constant, etc.).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SC 12.</strong> No. Dynamic equilibrium  means two opposing processes must be occurring at exactly the same rate. When  the salt is being poured in, it is dissolving at a far greater rate than it is  crystallizing.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SC 13.</strong> A salt crystal is both  dissolving and crystallizing at the same rate. As such, the mass of the crystal  remains constant, even though it is constantly being broken and reformed.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SC 14.</strong> Create a saturated  solution of strontium chloride with some undissolved solute visible at the  bottom. Add a few drops of radioactive strontium chloride; then measure where  the radiation is coming from within the solution. After time passes, if  radiation is coming from within the solid, that means the radioactive sample  has crystallized into the solid.</p>
