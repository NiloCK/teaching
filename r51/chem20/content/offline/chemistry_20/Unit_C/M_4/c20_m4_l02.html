<p>All organisms  require clean water in order to survive. Have you ever tried to keep tropical  fish? The chemistry of successfully maintaining an aquarium&mdash;especially a  saltwater aquarium&mdash;is underestimated by most people who have not had to  maintain one.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>To properly  manage an aquarium, you must test the water&rsquo;s composition of dissolved  substances. Some of these substances include</p>
<ul>
  <li>chlorine</li>
  <li>ammonia and nitrites</li>
  <li>phosphates</li>
  <li>oxygen</li>
  <li>salt (only in a saltwater aquarium)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to know more about aquarium water quality, read <a href="c20_m4_l02_water_in_the_aquarium.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson you will  learn why substances dissolve in water. You will also learn that aquarium  chemistry provides valuable insight into the role of dissolved substances in  delicate natural ecosystems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Essential Questions<strong><br />
</strong> </h6>
<ul>
  <li>How did Arrhenius contribute to the understanding of electrolytes,  acids, and bases?</li>
  <li>What does it mean to dissolve a substance?</li>
  <li>What role does energy have in the dissolving of a substance?  </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will complete the Module 4 Assignment 2 in this lesson. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that the questions that are not marked by the teacher provide you with the practice and feedback that you need to successfully complete this course. You should respond to all the questions and place those answers in your course folder.</p>
