<p>Many solutions found in a  lab are not actually bought as solutions but as solutes&mdash;the solutions are made  in the lab by dissolving the solute in water. This procedure greatly reduces  the transportation costs of bringing chemical solutions to the end user. A  bottle of antacid tablets is economical since you can make 100 antacid  solutions from an initial purchase of five dollars. If these 100 solutions all  had to be bought separately as solutions, they would cost hundreds of dollars! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Preparing  solutions requires the use of specialized glassware. Using appropriate  glassware allows for the preparation of solutions with precise concentrations.  Here are some of the specialized glassware you will use in preparing solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><br />
Volumetric  Flask</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2block">
  <p><img src="../../images/m4/042_flask.jpg" alt="A photograph of a volumetric flask. The bottom of the flask has a bulb shape and the flask has a long neck with a white graduation line along its length." width="305" height="390" /></p>
  </div>
<p>Volumetric containers are used to measure a specific volume with a very  high degree of precision. For example, a 100-mL volumetric flask has a white  line that indicates 100 mL. The line is specific for each flask, and its  location was determined at standard temperature. This calibration process makes  volumetric flasks some of the most precise equipment in a chemistry lab. <br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Volumetric  Pipette</strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2block">
  <p><img src="../../images/m4/043_pipette.jpg" alt="A volumetric pipette and bulb. The pipette is a long thin glass tube with an oval bulge in its middle. The bulb is a compressible rubber object with a plastic cap to fit over the end of the pipette." width="305" height="235" /></p>
  </div>
<p>A volumetric pipette is also a calibrated piece of glassware, but it is  used for lower volumes. Look at the pipettes in Figures 12 and 13 on the bottom  of <span class="nowrap">page 800</span> of your textbook. A 10-mL volumetric pipette has only one line  indicating precisely 10&nbsp;mL. Graduated pipettes may have markings for each  0.1 mL. See the graduated pipette at the bottom of the page in <span class="nowrap">Figure 13.</span></p>

<p>In  these videos, you have the opportunity to watch the process to  prepare a solution of specific, accurate concentration (a  standard solution) and to answer the self check question. Pause the video so you can  complete the question and check your answers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you cannot view the video, a listing of these steps also appears in  &quot;Preparing a Standard Solution from a Solid Reagent&quot; on page 803 of  your textbook.<br />
  &nbsp; <br />
  <strong>Self Check Question :</strong> A standard solution of 0.350-mol/L iron(II) sulfate&mdash;water (1/7) is to be prepared. The  required volume is 100.00 mL, and the solute has the chemical formula FeSO<span class="subscript">4</span>&bull;7H<span class="subscript">2</span>O(s).  Describe how to prepare this solution.</p>
