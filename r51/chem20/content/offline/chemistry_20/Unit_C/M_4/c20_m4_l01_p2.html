<p>Companies that  sell bottled water generate millions of dollars  in profit.  Bottled-water consumption is growing  every year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your course folder,  write about your thoughts on the following topics related to  bottled water:</p>
<ul>
  <li>    Do you drink bottled water on a regular basis? Why or why not?</li>
  </ul>
<ul>
  <li>    In your opinion, do you feel bottled water is safer than tap  water? Give reasons or examples to back up your opinion.</li>
  </ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Some religious and human rights organizations have expressed concern  about the &ldquo;privatization&rdquo; of water and feel it is unethical to repackage a  basic necessity of life  for profit. Opponents to this objection often refer to the fact that food and  shelter are just as vital, and since those items are sold as commodities, why  not water too? What is your opinion about selling water?</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Share your answers with your classmates or some other people.

<p>Matter is a very general term  that refers to anything that has mass and occupies space. Scientists subdivide  matter into two broad categories: pure substances and mixtures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A pure substance consists of one  chemical only and may be subcategorized as either an element or a compound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A mixture consists of two or more  substances and may be subcategorized as either homogeneous or heterogeneous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A homogeneous mixture may  appear to contain only one substance with uniform properties, but in reality it  may contain several different substances. A solution is a type of homogeneous  mixture composed of at least one solute and one solvent. Can you think of any  other examples of homogeneous mixtures?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A heterogeneous mixture visibly  contains two or more different components. A chocolate chip cookie is a  heterogeneous mixture since the chocolate chips can be seen as being separate  from the rest of the cookie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more  information on the different forms of matter, read &ldquo;Classifying  Matter&rdquo; on pages 12 and 13 of your textbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>For more information on methods used to isolate the different components  of matter in a mixture, read &ldquo;Crystallization&rdquo; and  &ldquo;Filtration&rdquo; on pages 802 and 803 in your textbook. </p>
