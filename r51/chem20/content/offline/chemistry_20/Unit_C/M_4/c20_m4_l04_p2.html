<p>Many terms are  used to describe the concentration of a solution. A powdered drink mix added to  a large quantity of water is called a dilute solution, whereas a powdered drink  mix added to a small quantity of water is considered to be a concentrated  solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Dilute</em> and <em>concentrated</em> are qualitative terms that  only have meaning in the context of comparing similar solutions. Saying a  solution is dilute provides no information about the specific quantities of  solute and solvent.</p>
<p><br />
  </p>
<div class="right1blockC"><strong>concentration: </strong>a property of solutions; the mass, volume, or number of moles of solute present in proportion to the quantity of solvent or total solution</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Concentration</strong> is defined as the ratio of the quantities of solute to the total  solution. This ratio can be written in a variety of ways. As you progress  through your exploration of solution chemistry, you will encounter  concentrations in many different forms. These forms of showing concentration  will be important when you study the maximum allowable concentrations of  contaminants in drinking water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Percentage Concentrations</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next time  you pick up a container, look at the label. Chances are that the liquid inside  is a solution, and the label will express the concentration of a component.  What might surprise you is that a variety of means to express concentration is  used. In this section you will learn about the most common methods for  expressing the concentration for commercial and other purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Percentage  Volume per Volume (% V/V)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read and  carefully work through &ldquo;COMMUNICATION example 1&rdquo; on page 203 in your textbook.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you have  completed your reading, work through the following example, followed by the  Self-Check problems below.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> 40 mL of  hydrogen peroxide is poured into 150 mL of water. Determine the % V/V  concentration of this solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This question  is different since the water volume is given instead of the total solution  volume. It&rsquo;s easy to get the solution volume. It is 40 mL + 150 mL = 190 mL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Now, divide the volume of hydrogen peroxide by the total volume of the  solution.

<p><strong>SC 1. </strong>A 350-mL solution  contains 140 mL of ethanol. Determine the % V/V concentration of this solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 2.</strong> A 450-mL solution  contains 160 mL of liquid hydrogen peroxide. Determine the % V/V concentration  of this solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 3.</strong> 65 mL of methanol is  poured into 230 mL of water. Determine the % V/V concentration of this  solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 4.</strong> A 2.1-L solution  contains 54 mL of methanol. Determine the % V/V concentration of this solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SC 5.</strong> A  vinegar solution contains acetic acid in water and is labelled 11% V/V. Express  this concentration as mL per 100 mL of solution.</p>
