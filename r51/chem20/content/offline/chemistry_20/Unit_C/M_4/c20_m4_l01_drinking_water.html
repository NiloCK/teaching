    <td valign="middle"><p><em>Escherichia    coli</em> comes in 50 different strains, most of which are harmless. However, some strains, such as <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7, can cause severe illness. This particular strain is found in the  intestines of humans and other warm-blooded animals. It enters the water supply primarily though fecal contamination and waste water discharges. Illness from <em>E. Coli</em> O157:H7 includes bloody diarrhea and, in severe cases, kidney failure and death.</p></td>

    <td align="center" valign="middle"><p>protozoa</p></td>
    <td valign="middle"><p>A common protozoan that causes human illness is the <em>Giardia </em>parasite, which causes beaver fever. Symptoms of this illness include fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. The primary source of contamination is    fecal waste. Giardiasis is called beaver fever because it is commonly contracted by campers who drink untreated water contaminated by fecal waste. Beavers are often blamed for the illness since they are commonly observed in water contaminated with the parasite. As it turns out, all animal waste (including human waste) has the potential to carry this protozoan. </p></td>

    <td align="center" valign="middle"><p>viruses</p></td>
    <td valign="middle"><p>Viruses that may persist in untreated water include hepatitis A and E and the Norwalk virus. The Norwalk virus enters the water supply primarily though fecal contamination and waste water discharges. Symptoms include fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. It is especially hazardous to the young and elderly. In Edmonton, Capital Health recorded 72 Norwalk virus outbreaks between September 2005 and August 2006. However, the most common transmission of the Norwalk virus is person-to-person transmission due to ineffective hand washing.</p></td>

<p>Chemical contamination is checked for regularly because there are a variety of health-related issues from  ingesting hazardous chemicals. In general, most chemical pollution is the result of human-based activities.</p>

    <td valign="top"><p>Pesticides are organic compounds that enter the water supply through direct application or surface runoff. An ecological problem associated with pesticides is that they can enter organisms at the bottom of the food chain and become concentrated higher up the food chain in the process called biomagnification. Pesticides have been linked to cancer and birth defects in humans.</p></td>

    <td valign="top"><p>The long-term effects of random consumer items accumulating in the water supply are unknown at this time. Hormones, antibiotics, antidepressants, and heart medications are chemicals that persist in the water supply and resist breaking down naturally. At the current time, water treatment does not include the removal or monitoring of these chemicals. As such, they can be found in tap water, albeit in extremely small amounts. </p></td>
