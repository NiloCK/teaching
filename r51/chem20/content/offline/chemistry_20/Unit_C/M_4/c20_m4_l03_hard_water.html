<h6>Different Types of Hard-Water Buildup</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Calcium is  present in tap water in the form of calcium carbonate. Even though calcium  carbonate is generally insoluble in water, the concentration is so low that it  remains dissolved in solution. Depending on the context, hard-water buildup can  arise in different ways: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>hot-water buildup </strong>(found in pipes, kitchen  appliances, bathroom fixtures, etc.) <br />
    Calcium carbonate is a unique ionic solid&mdash;it becomes <em>less</em> soluble when the water temperature  increases! Consider boiling hard water in a pot on the stove. As the water  heats up and reaches a boil, calcium carbonate precipitates out of the  solution, forming a residue on the bottom and sides of the pot. This is similar  to the hard-water buildup that occurs in pipes and other fixtures that use hot  water.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>soap scum </strong>(found on dishes, shower  curtains, etc.) <br />
    Soaps contain organic acids that react with magnesium and calcium in hard water  to form an insoluble salt. This can result in the residue commonly found on  dishes and shower curtains.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>evaporation </strong>(found on surfaces where  hard water evaporates)<br />
    When hard water evaporates, all dissolved solutes will be left behind as the  water dries up. If you have ever cleaned a glass table top with tap water (and  no other cleaning agents), you have likely observed the spots associated with  hard-water evaporation.<br />
  </li>
  </ul>
<p>
    Do you have a pot or fixture that has hard-water buildup? It is easy to  remove hard-water calcium deposits using an acid solution, such as vinegar. If  the buildup is on a flat surface, cover the surface with vinegar for several  minutes and the buildup will dissolve. If the surface is upright, you could  scrub the surface with a paper towel soaked in vinegar. Commercial products are  also available for this process and can usually do the job more quickly.
