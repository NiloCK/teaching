Have you ever  had a shower that left you feeling like you weren&rsquo;t able to wash all the soap  off your body?&nbsp; Tap water, especially in Alberta is often &ldquo;hard&rdquo;  due to the presence of calcium and magnesium dissolved in the water. While hard  water is safe to drink, there are problems associated with its use.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The minerals  found in hard water have a tendency to form limescale deposits in household  pipes, reducing the flow of water. Also, kitchen and bathroom fixtures that  regularly use tap water may build up soap scum due to the fact that calcium  and magnesium can react with detergents to form a residue that is difficult to  rinse away. You may wish to view some examples of problems caused by <a href="c20_m4_l03_hard_water.html" target="_blank">hard  water</a>.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In this lesson you will learn about the solubility of various substances  in water. You will also learn about the chemistry of water softeners, a common  way to treat hard water.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<h6>Essential Questions </h6>
<ul>
	<li>What are saturated solutions?</li>
	<li>How can you predict the solubility of a substance in water?</li>
	<li>How is dynamic equilibrium involved when studying saturated  solutions?</li>
</ul>
