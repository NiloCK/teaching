<p>Have you or  someone you know ever sprained an ankle or wrist? Did it swell and change  colour? It was probably wrapped in a stretchy bandage and iced. When a tissue  injury occurs, such as a pulled muscle or a sprain, capillaries break and blood  leaks into the surrounding tissue. This leakage causes swelling to occur and  leads to significant pain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If cold is  applied to the injury immediately after it happens, the blood vessels constrict  and release less fluid. This change can minimize the pain associated with the  injury. The advantages of quickly reducing swelling to an injured area have  made cold packs a required item in most sports trainers' kits. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An unused cold pack is normally at room temperature and feels like a  plastic bag filled with water. However, when the cold pack is forcefully  squeezed, an inner package breaks and the contents are allowed to mix. The cold  pack becomes cold! By the end of this lesson, you will understand how a  theoretical understanding of solution chemistry can explain this surprising  result.</p>

  <p><strong>endothermic process:</strong> a change in matter    that requires an input of energy to occur</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>exothermic process: </strong>a change in matter    that releases energy when it occurs</p>
</div>
<p>Read the  section &ldquo;Energy Changes&rdquo; on pages 199 and 200 in your textbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you read in  the section of your textbook, several steps are involved when a solid dissolves  in water to form aqueous ions. The first two steps require energy to break  bonds and are <strong>endothermic</strong>.  An endothermic process absorbs energy from the surroundings, making the  surroundings cooler. The final step releases energy as bonds form and is <strong>exothermic</strong>. An exothermic process  is the opposite of an endothermic one, releasing energy into the surroundings  and warming the surroundings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following steps essentially happen simultaneously but are separated  for your understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<div class="right2block"><img src="../../images/m4/011_breaking_bonds.jpg" alt="A diagram shows alternating yellow and green spheres organized in three dimensions. The green spheres are labeled with a negative sign, and the yellow spheres are labeled with a plus sign. A water molecule represented by a single red sphere and two white spheres is beside one of the outer yellow spheres. Another water molecule is beside one of the outer green spheres. Red arrows point from each of the water molecules toward the yellow and green spheres. A label beside the arrow reads: Energy is required to break the ionic bonds holding the ions together." width="305" height="270" /></div>
<p><strong>Step 1: Breaking Bonds in</strong> <strong>the Solute (Endothermic)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ions in the solid are held together with ionic bonds. These bonds must be  broken before dissociation can occur. This step is endothermic because the  energy required to break the bond comes from polar interactions with water  molecules. (Think of the water molecule pulling the ion out from the solid.) As  the water molecules use up their energy to break this bond, the solution cools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2block"><img src="../../images/m4/012_breaking_bonds.jpg" alt="The diagram shows a single green sphere surrounded by many water molecules. At the other side of the diagram, a single yellow sphere is surrounded by water molecules. Attractive forces between particles are shown by dotted lines. Dotted lines are shown between one water molecule and the green sphere. Dotted lines are shown between one water molecule and the yellow sphere.  Dotted lines are shown between the other water molecules in the diagram. The dotted lines between the water molecules are labeled with  red arrows. The label on the arrows reads: Energy must be supplied to break hydrogen bonds between water molecules." width="305" height="301" /></div>
<p><strong>Step 2: Breaking Bonds in  the Solvent  (Endothermic)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The water molecules in the solution may be hydrogen bonded to other water  molecules. These hydrogen bonds must be broken before the water molecules can  be available for dissolving the ions from the solute. This step is also  endothermic, and the surrounding water cools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="right2block"><img src="../../images/m4/013_breaking-bonds.jpg" alt="The diagram shows a single green sphere surrounded by many water molecules. Dotted lines are shown between the yellow sphere and the water molecules.  At the other side of the diagram, a single yellow sphere is surrounded by water molecules. The diagram label reads: Energy is finally released when bonds form between the ions and water molecules." width="305" height="276" /></div>
<p><strong>Step 3:  Dissolving the Solute (Exothermic)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Now that the ions are in solution and sufficient water molecules are  free, bonds form between the water molecules and the ions. This step is  exothermic and releases energy, warming the surrounding water.<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you have  just learned, the dissolving process involves both endothermic and exothermic  processes. The overall energy of dissolving a solid can be determined using the  following formula:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;energy required  to break bonds in solute<br />
  + energy required to break intermolecular bonds in water <br />
  &ndash; energy released when bonds form between ions and water molecules <br />
  ____________________________________________________________ <br />
  = total change  in energy<br />
  <br />
  Based on this  formula, if the energy required is more than the energy released, there is an  energy deficit and the solution will cool down. If the energy required is less  than the energy released, there is an energy surplus and the solution will warm  up. In Chemistry 20 you will not be able to predict whether dissolving an ionic  compound is an endothermic or exothermic process. The only way you can tell,  for now, is by dissolving each substance in water and measuring the change in  temperature. In Chemistry 30 you will learn how to use mathematics to predict  the energy released.</p>
