<h6>Saturated Solutions</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2blockC">
  <p><strong>saturated solution:</strong> a solution that contains  the maximum quantity of solute for a specified temperature; in which no more  solute will dissolve at a specified temperature; at maximum solute concentration</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>solubility:</strong> the concentration of a  saturated solution at a specified temperature</p>
</div>
<p>In the Try This  activity in the previous page you observed a <strong>saturated</strong> <strong>solution</strong> undergoing change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a  limit to how much solute can be dissolved in a solvent. You may notice this  when you pour sugar into tea or coffee. If you pour in too much, the sugar will  simply sit at the bottom of the cup. The following illustration shows what  happens when maximum solubility is reached.<br />
  &nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>solubility</strong> of NaCl(s) in water at 20 &deg;C is 36 g/100 mL. What that means is only 36 g of  solute may be absorbed by 100 mL of water at this temperature. </p>

Above each beaker is a drawing of a spoon containing a powder.  The spoon above the first beaker has the maximum amount of powder in it. The contents of the beaker appear light grey in colour. The label below the first beaker reads: There are 50g of salt in the spoon. The spoon above the second beaker has some of the powder removed. The contents of the second beaker appears light blue in colour. The label below the second beaker reads: 30g is poured into the solution. All the solute dissolves. The spoon above the third beaker has most of the powder removed. The contents of the third beaker appears light blue in colour. Some white powder is shown on the bottom of the beaker. The label below the third beaker reads: Another 10g is poured into the solution. 4g of undissolved solute remains on the bottom. The spoon above the fourth beaker has all of the powder removed. The contents of the fourth beaker appears light blue in colour. A larger quantity of white powder is shown on the bottom of the beaker. The label below the fourth beaker reads: When the rest of the salt is poured into the solution, 14g of undissolved solute remains on the bottom." width="500" height="224" /></div>

<h6>Hard Water vs. Soft Water</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the  introduction to this lesson, you learned about some of the problems associated  with hard water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is soft  water, and how does a water softener work? Soft water is free of calcium and  magnesium ions. A water softener works because of the presence of an  ion-exchange resin, which is typically found in the water filter as small  beads. The ion-exchange resin functions by removing magnesium and calcium ions  from the water in a process that exchanges them for sodium ions. In other  words, the price you pay for getting soft water is that the water becomes  salty.</p>
<p>Some of the  benefits of using soft water in the home include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Soap lathers more readily and does not leave a residue (soap  scum).</li>
  <li>Laundry is brighter and can endure more washings before fading.</li>
  <li>Pipes do not develop buildup, and hot water tanks last longer.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the  negative issues include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Calcium and magnesium are required by the body, and the  water-softening process removes these valuable minerals.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>The characteristic taste of water is caused by the presence of  minerals. Removing the minerals makes the water taste different. Some people  may like the taste, but that is a matter of preference.</li>
</ul>
<p>The process of softening water increases the sodium content of water.  This results in the water being slightly salty.</p>
