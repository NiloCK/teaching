<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Lesson Summary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the beginning of this lesson, you were asked  the following essential questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is a solution?</li>
  <li>What kind of mixture is a solution?</li>
</ul>
<p>Many people  know that gold is a yellow metal, but they have no idea what white gold is.  People will often say that a white gold ring contains platinum! You have now  learned that white gold does indeed contain gold, but the gold is in an alloy  solution with other metals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before  completing this lesson, you likely thought the term <em>solution</em> was nothing more than another way of saying that  something is a liquid. As you have seen, solutions are far more varied and may  exist as solids, liquids, or gases. You also learned that solutions are defined  as homogeneous mixtures, preventing things like milk and fog from being  classified as solutions. Finally, the unique properties of solutions were  explored, and you learned how they can be used to distinguish visually  identical solutions from one another in the lab.</p>

<h5>Lesson Glossary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>aqueous  phase:</strong> a phase denoting a  highly soluble substance that has been dissolved in water; denoted by (aq)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>conductivity:</strong> the ability of a  solution to transfer  an electric current</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>electrolyte:</strong> a solution or a molten substance that conducts an electric current</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>nonelectrolyte:</strong> a solution or a molten substance that does not conduct an electric current</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>solution: </strong>a homogeneous mixture  of at least one solute dissolved in a solvent</p>
<p><br />
    <strong>solute:</strong> a component of a solution, the material that  dissolves in the solvent</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>solvent: </strong>a component of a solution,  the material in which the solute dissolves</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>turbidity:</strong> the measure of the clarity of a clear  liquid</p>
