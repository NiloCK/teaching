<h4><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" /> Module Summary</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think  back to the questions you were asked at the beginning of the module.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are some of your preconceived notions about  solution chemistry?<br />
  </li>
  <li>Have you acquired new knowledge from this module that  contradicts prior beliefs?</li>
</ul>
<p>As you worked through these lessons, you likely came across a few  things that challenged your prior beliefs about solutions. Perhaps the following  thoughts came to mind: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Brass and air are solutions, even though  you likely never thought they were.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>While the dissolving process of sugar and  salt may appear to be visually identical, they dissolve in water for different  reasons.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Crystals of salt or  sugar at the bottom of a saturated solution are not static.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>The improper disposal of computers can  have an effect on people living as far north as the Arctic. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
