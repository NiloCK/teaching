<p>Fill a cup with  approximately 100 mL of lukewarm water. Add a teaspoon of salt, stirring until  all of the salt has dissolved. Repeat this procedure until you notice salt on  the bottom that does not dissolve, no matter how much you stir.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you are  observing is an example of a saturated salt solution. You were probably able to  get 5 teaspoons to dissolve, but the sixth one would not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now pour the  solution into another glass, making sure none of the undissolved salt is  transferred. Put this glass in your freezer for about half an hour, and then  observe it. Record your observations. Allow the cooled salt water from the  freezer to sit at room temperature. Record any changes that occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you explain  the changes that occurred with the salt water as you cooled it and allowed it  to warm?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Share your explanation with your classmates or some other people.</p>
