<p>Tap water is a  critical component of your day-to-day life. You probably use far more  water than you think. According to Environment Canada, the average Canadian  household uses 335 L of water per day. The uses for water are broken down as  follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>35% bathing and showering </p>
<p>30% flushing the toilet</p>
<p>20% laundry</p>
<p>10% drinking and kitchen chores</p>
<p>5% cleaning</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you turn on the tap to  fill a glass with water, you have certain expectations for what comes out. If  the water is coloured or smells foul, you would likely suspect that something  is present in the water that you do not want to consume. What is present in tap  water? Why is it there? What substances were removed during its processing? You  may have heard that Canadian drinking water is among the safest in the world,  but are you aware of how water is treated and monitored?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this module  you will study the processes involved with bringing drinking water from a natural source, such as a  river, to your home. You will also study how water is able to form solutions  with many substances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This module will focus on the big questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is a solution?</li>
  <li>Why are solutions often used to study chemical systems? </li>
</ul>
<p>As you complete  each lesson in this module, you will investigate the following essential  questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is a solution?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>What kind of mixture is a solution?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How did Arrhenius contribute to the understanding of electrolytes,  acids, and bases?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>What does it mean to dissolve a substance?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>What role does energy have in the dissolving of a substance?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How can you predict the solubility of a substance in water?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How is dynamic equilibrium involved when studying a saturated  solution?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How is solution concentration expressed?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How do you calculate amount concentration and determine  concentration of species in a solution?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How are solutions prepared?</li>
</ul>
<p>As a citizen  you will consume tap water for many years to come. You may become interested in  questions such as &ldquo;What is in the water?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How much is able to be made  available?&rdquo;</p>
