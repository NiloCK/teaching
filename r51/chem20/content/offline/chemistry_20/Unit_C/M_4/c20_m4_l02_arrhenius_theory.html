<h4>Lesson 2&mdash;<strong>Dissolving  Substances</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>Arrhenius's Theory</strong></h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results  from Arrhenius&rsquo;s research led him to say that ionic compounds <strong>dissociate</strong>, meaning they separate  into positive and negative ions. This was the first readily accepted  theoretical explanation for the conductivity of solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to  Arrhenius, electrolytes, such as sodium chloride, dissolve and dissociate.  Nonelectrolytes, such as sugar, dissolve but do not dissociate. This can be  shown with the following equations:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>electrolyte:</strong> NaCl(s) &rarr; Na<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq) + Cl<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq)<br />
  <br />
  <strong>nonelectrolyte:</strong> C<span class="subscript">12</span>H<span class="subscript">22</span>O<span class="subscript">11</span>(s)  &rarr; C<span class="subscript">12</span>H<span class="subscript">22</span>O<span class="subscript">11</span>(aq)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2blockB">
  <p><strong>Arrhenius acid: </strong>a substance that ionizes in water to produce hydrogen ions</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Arrhenius base:</strong> an ionic compound that  dissociates in water to produce hydroxide ions</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>dissociation:</strong> the separation of ions that  occurs when an ionic compound dissolves in water</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>ionization:</strong> a process by which a  neutral atom or molecule is converted to an ion; the reaction of substances in  water to create ions</p>
</div>
<p>Arrhenius also  developed a powerful theoretical explanation to explain acids and bases at the  molecular level. If an ionic compound  dissociates to yield hydroxide ions in solution, it&rsquo;s an <strong>Arrhenius base</strong>.  This theory accounts for why substances, such as NaOH(s) and Ba(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span>(s),  form basic solutions&mdash;they give off OH<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>  ions when dissolved in water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acids were more  difficult to explain because they contain covalent bonds rather than ionic  bonds. Nevertheless,&nbsp;if a substance<strong> ionizes</strong> to produce hydrogen ions in  solution, it&rsquo;s an <strong>Arrhenius acid</strong>.  The term <em>ionize</em> is used because  the charged particles are created when the molecule breaks up&mdash;they are not  initially present like they are in bases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the successes of  Arrhenius&rsquo;s theory was its ability to explain neutralization reactions.  Hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions combine in a one-to-one ratio to produce  liquid water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>H<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq) + OH<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq) &rarr; H<span class="subscript">2</span>O(l)</p>
