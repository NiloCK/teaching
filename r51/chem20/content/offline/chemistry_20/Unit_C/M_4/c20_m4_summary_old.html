<h3 class="unitCh3">Module 4&mdash;Properties of Solutions</h3>
<h4><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" /> Module Summary</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think  back to the questions you were asked at the beginning of the module.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are some of your preconceived notions about  solution chemistry?<br />
  </li>
  <li>Have you acquired new knowledge from this module that  contradicts prior beliefs?</li>
</ul>
<p>As you worked through these lessons, you likely came across a few  things that challenged your prior beliefs about solutions. Perhaps the following  thoughts came to mind: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Brass and air are solutions, even though  you likely never thought they were.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>While the dissolving process of sugar and  salt may appear to be visually identical, they dissolve in water for different  reasons.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Crystals of salt or  sugar at the bottom of a saturated solution are not static.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>The improper disposal of computers can  have an effect on people living as far north as the Arctic. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Proactive Citizen Projects: Topics</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Part  1: The Water Supply and You</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Project  A</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complete the  following activity and add your work to your course folder.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Search your house and locate       five potentially dangerous solutions. To find as many different types as       possible, look in more places than underneath your kitchen sink. After you       have decided on your five solutions, make a list of them and summarize all       the important safety precautions for each solution. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Select two products that have       specific warnings on the label, such as warnings about mixing one product       with another and storage temperature. Using the Internet or your library,       research what would happen if these warnings were ignored. <strong>Do not try any experiments yourself.</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Select two solutions that are       poisonous. Research what would happen if these particular solutions were       ingested. What should be done if someone accidentally swallows these solutions?</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Some of the solutions in your       list may be dangerous to the environment. Research how to safely dispose of       each of your five solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Project  B</strong> <br />
    <br />
  Untreated water can lead to a variety of health problems. Fortunately, water  treatment plants exist to make sure the water reaching your home meets strict  government standards. Despite the efforts of municipalities to provide clean  and safe drinking water, many people believe that tap water is still unsafe and  they choose to drink bottled water. Write an essay that answers the following  question:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many people  believe that bottled water is safer than tap water. Do scientific facts justify  this belief?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may use the  Internet or your library to research this issue. To begin your research you may  want to use relevant terms in a variety of combinations. Also, you may wish to  consult your class and review the discussion postings from other students to  find ideas for your essay.<br />
  &nbsp; </p>
<h6>Part  2: Who&rsquo;s Looking Out for Your Safety?</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Project  C</strong> <br />
    <br />
  Toxicologists study adverse effects of chemicals on living  organisms. Write an essay or create an illustration, slide presentation,  podcast, or mindmap describing the discipline of toxicology. You may wish to  incorporate some of the following ideas into your paper. Feel free to come up  with your own ideas too. </p>
<ul>
  <li>What are some examples  of topics a toxicologist would study?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Which industries hire  toxicologists?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>What laboratory  techniques do toxicologists use?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>What kind of education is required to  become a toxicologist? What are some of the different specializations?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Project  D</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Salt can be a  problem in terrestrial ecosystems. Road salt used throughout the winter to melt  ice can increase the salinity of freshwater reserves close to areas where it is  used, impacting plants and animals.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>What are the  benefits and hazards of road salt?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Write an essay or create an illustration,  slide presentation, or mindmap that addresses this question from many  perspectives and situations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Part 3: When Is Salty Water Not Safe to  Consume?</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Project  E</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right1block">
  <p><img src="../../images/m4/046_pickles.jpg" alt="A photograph showing a glass jar containing pickled cucumbers." width="160" height="240" /></p>
  <p class="credit">&copy; EuToch/shutterstock</p>
</div>
<p>Water softeners  use an ion-exchange resin that removes calcium and magnesium from hard water.  However, this process releases sodium ions during the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the  increased salinity of soft water, the amount of sodium released from a water softener  is tiny compared to the amount of salt people consume in food. Therefore, it  does not pose a significant health risk, even to those on salt-reduced diets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At what point would salty water become dangerous if consumed? Why can salt water be dangerous to consume,  even if its concentration is similar to that of our blood?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Write text or  create an illustration, cartoon, slide presentation, podcast, or mindmap to  provide an explanation to these questions. In order to be convincing, you must  include scientific principles that back up your statements. Save your work to  your course folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Part 4: Understanding Guidelines for  Canadian Drinking Water</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Project F </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this project you will create a pamphlet, comic strip, or slide presentation  that summarizes important details about drinking water in your area. Some of  the topics you may wish to discuss are</p>
<ul>
  <li>the source of the water supply (surface water or groundwater;  location)<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>the water treatment plant that services your area<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>environmental concerns about your local water<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>links to local websites that discuss your drinking water (e.g.,  municipal government websites)<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>consumer information (e.g., water rates)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Project  G</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most water  treatment plants give tours of their operations. Arrange a tour of your local  water treatment plant and write a report that describes how your water is  treated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Part 5: Household Environmental Hazards </h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Project  H</strong> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Batteries and computer equipment often contain heavy metals, such as mercury  and cadmium. These metals can be released into environmental water systems if  the equipment is disposed of improperly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research the  ecological impact of heavy metals in the food chain. Design a poster, slide  presentation, or diagram that explains the dangers of simply disposing of these  items in the trash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Project  I</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Pesticides can  have tremendous value in the lawn and garden, but they do have environmental  risks associated with them. Research the risks associated with pesticide use,  and investigate possible alternatives. Imagine you are responsible for  marketing a pesticide alternative for gardeners. Write a sales pitch and then  create an ad or podcast that would convey the environmental need to switch  products as well as make consumers feel it is a better choice for their  backyards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Proactive Citizen Projects: Scoring Guide</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The projects listed above have different aspects and requirements. Therefore your teacher may decide to use one  or more of the following scoring criteria to grade your project. Consult with your teacher to find out which  criteria will be used to judge your work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although only criteria for  grades of 4 and 2 out of 4 are shown, it will be possible for you to obtain  grades of 3, 1, and 0 if your work falls below the criteria described.</p>
