<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Lesson Summary </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson you explored the following essential  questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How did Arrhenius contribute to the understanding of electrolytes,  acids, and bases?</li>
  <li>What does it mean to dissolve a substance?</li>
  <li>What role does energy have in the dissolving of a solid?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dissolving a  solute might seem quite simple, but as you have learned from your work in this  lesson, many events at the molecular level are involved with this process.  Imagine for a moment what life would be like if dissociation and intermolecular  forces did not exist. Without dissociation, a beaker of water could not  dissolve ionic solids&mdash;they would simply accumulate at the bottom. Without  intermolecular forces, sugars could not dissolve, and you would be deprived of  an energy source required for survival.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Now that you have learned about the many chemical events required to  dissolve a solid, you can appreciate how complex processes at the molecular  level can result in simplicity at the macroscopic level. While billions of  bonds are being broken and formed in the endothermic process of dissolving  ammonium chloride in a cold pack, you get to simply squeeze the bag, shake, and  apply.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arrhenius acid:</strong> a substance that ionizes in  water to produce hydrogen ions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arrhenius base:</strong> an ionic compound that  dissociates in water to produce hydroxide ions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dissociation:</strong> the separation of ions that  occurs when an ionic compound dissolves in water</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>endothermic:</strong> absorbing energy from the  surroundings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>exothermic:</strong> releasing energy to the  surroundings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ionization:</strong> a process by which a  neutral atom or molecule is converted to an ion; the reaction of substances in  water to create ions</p>
