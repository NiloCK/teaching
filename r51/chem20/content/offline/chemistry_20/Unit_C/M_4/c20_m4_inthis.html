<h3 class="unitCh3">Module 4&mdash;Properties of Solutions</h3>
<h4>In This Module</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson 1&mdash;Classifying Matter and Solutions</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you hear  the term <em>solution</em>, you probably  visualize all the cleaning supplies in your home. While it&rsquo;s true these  products are solutions, there are many other items around your home that are  solutions as well! For example, a gold ring is a metal-metal solution called an  alloy. In this lesson you will learn how to properly classify matter and  solutions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is a solution?</li>
  <li>What kind of mixture is a solution?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 2&mdash;Dissolving Substances </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dissolving a  substance seems to be a very simple process when you observe it&mdash;simply throw a  suitable solid into water and it disappears. However, the theoretical reasons  for this process baffled scientists for centuries. In this lesson you will  learn how Svante Arrhenius contributed to solution chemistry with his theories  of electrolyte dissociation. You will also learn how bond energy plays a  critical role in the dissolving process, allowing for the existence of products  like cold packs and heat packs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>How did Arrhenius contribute to the understanding of electrolytes,  acids, and bases?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>What does it mean to dissolve a substance?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>What role does energy have in the dissolving of a substance?</li>
  </ul>
<h5>Lesson 3&mdash;Solubility</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This lesson  discusses the qualitative aspects of solubility. Solutions are not capable of  holding an unlimited amount of solute. At some point the solute will simply  start collecting at the bottom of the container. There are many factors that  can affect the solubility of a solid or a gas in solution, and you will learn  about these factors both empirically and theoretically.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are saturated solutions?</li>
  <li>How can you predict the solubility of a substance in water?</li>
  <li>How is dynamic equilibrium involved when studying saturated  solutions?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 4&mdash;Concentration I </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Concentration  is a quantitative aspect of solution chemistry that provides a comparison of  the amount of solute to the amount of solution. There are many methods of  expressing concentration in consumer products, and you will learn how and why  these methods are used. You will also learn how concentration measurements are  used in a wide variety of applications.</p>
<ul>
  <li>How can the concentration of solute in a solution be expressed?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 5&mdash;Concentration II </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Concentration  must be expressed in a lab using moles rather than mass. Otherwise, mathematical  relationships between the entities in a balanced chemical equation cannot be  described in a straightforward manner. In this lesson you will learn how to  calculate amount concentrations in a variety of situations. You will then learn  how amount concentrations can be applied to dissociated ions, dilution, and  solution preparation.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>How can the concentration of solute in a solution be expressed?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How do you calculate amount concentration and determine  concentration of species in a solution?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How are solutions prepared  in a lab?</li>
</ul>
