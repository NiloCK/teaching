<h3 class="unitCh3">Unit C Introduction</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this unit you will extend your study of chemical bonding  to gain a theoretical understanding of the properties of solutions. The  concepts presented in these modules provide a solid foundation for the study of  stoichiometry, which is covered in Unit D.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This unit has two modules. The  first module, Properties of Solutions, begins with an introduction to the  qualitative aspects of solution chemistry. You will learn how solutions are  classified and differentiated and why some substances dissolve while others do  not. The second half of the module deals with the quantitative nature of  solutions, primarily focusing on methods of expressing and calculating  concentration. As you work through this module, you will have the opportunity  to see how the concepts you learn apply to something you use every day&mdash;tap  water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second module, Acids and Bases, focuses on a key characteristic of  successful theories: their ability to accurately predict and/or explain  experimental results. If a theory is not able to be used to make accurate  predictions and/or explanations of experimental results, it can be restricted,  revised, or even replaced. You will see that Arrhenius&rsquo;s theory of acids and  bases was unable to explain experimental results in its original form. However,  over time, it has been revised to better predict or explain observations. You  will also be introduced to the quantitative aspects of acid-base chemistry and  related mathematical formulas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together these modules will help you learn how to investigate solutions,  describe their physical and chemical properties, and describe solutions qualitatively  and quantitatively.</p>
<p><br />
  Specifically, you will be able to</p>
<ul>
  <li>describe the qualitative  properties of solutions, acids, and bases<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>communicate the quantitative  properties of solutions, acids, and bases<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>evaluate the success of  scientific theories based on their ability to predict experimental results<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>investigate the chemistry behind  familiar scenarios in everyday life</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Module Descriptions</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Module 4&mdash;Properties of Solutions</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this module you will explore  the relationship between empirical properties and theoretical ideas, with an  emphasis on qualitative and quantitative analysis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The essential questions that you will look at in this module are</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are some of  your preconceived notions about solution chemistry?</li>
  <li>Have you acquired new knowledge from this module that contradicts       your prior beliefs? </li>
</ul>
  <h6>Module 5&mdash;Acids and Bases</h6>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In this module you will learn  the answers to these questions and explore several aspects of acid-base  chemistry.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In Lesson 2, there are theories,  like the Arrhenius&rsquo;s theory, that attempt to explain and predict the behaviour  of acidic and basic substances when they are dissolved in an aqueous solution.  However, you may have found situations where this theory was not adequate when  explaining and predicting your observations of the behaviour of an acid or  base. In this module you will learn why and in what way Arrhenius's theory  had to be modified to overcome these limitations.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The essential questions that you will look at in this module are</p>
  <ul type="disc">
  <li>Scientific theories are human inventions used to explain events       that occur in nature and predict future results. While learning acid-base       chemistry, you will pay more attention to different theories. What are the       limitations of the different theories you will use?<br />

<h3 class="unitCh3">Module 4&mdash;Properties of Solutions    </h3>
<h4>Module  Introduction</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you ever  wondered why salt dissolves in water? Scientists approach such questions by  studying the observable properties of a substance (also called empirical  properties) and relating them to accepted scientific theories of the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to  Aristotle, an ancient Greek philosopher, all matter could be classified as  fire, earth, air, and water. Aristotle reasoned that the dryness of salt makes  it a kind of earth and that water acted on earth in a process similar to the  way water erodes rocks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 1800s,  the scientific community generally accepted that small indivisible particles,  called atoms, were the building blocks of matter. Using the concept of atoms,  Svante Arrhenius was able to explain that the difference in conductivity  between salt and sugar solutions is due to a phenomenon known as dissociation.  In the 1900s electrons and intermolecular forces were known to chemists, so  chemists were able to use these new ideas in their theories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this module  you will explore the relationship between empirical properties and theoretical  ideas, with an emphasis on qualitative and quantitative analysis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think  about the following questions as you complete this module:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are some of your preconceived notions about solution  chemistry?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Have you acquired new knowledge from this module that contradicts  your prior beliefs?</li>

  <p class="credit">&copy; Tommy Maenhout/shutterstock</p>
</div>
<p>Tap water is a  critical component of your day-to-day life. You probably use far more  water than you think. According to Environment Canada, the average Canadian  household uses 335 L of water per day. The uses for water are broken down as  follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>35% bathing and showering </p>
<p>30% flushing the toilet</p>
<p>20% laundry</p>
<p>10% drinking and kitchen chores</p>
<p>5% cleaning</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you turn on the tap to  fill a glass with water, you have certain expectations for what comes out. If  the water is coloured or smells foul, you would likely suspect that something  is present in the water that you do not want to consume. What is present in tap  water? Why is it there? What substances were removed during its processing? You  may have heard that Canadian drinking water is among the safest in the world,  but are you aware of how water is treated and monitored?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this module  you will study the processes involved with bringing drinking water from a natural source, such as a  river, to your home. You will also study how water is able to form solutions  with many substances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This module will focus on the big questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is a solution?</li>
  <li>Why are solutions often used to study chemical systems? </li>
</ul>
<p>As you complete  each lesson in this module, you will investigate the following essential  questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is a solution?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>What kind of mixture is a solution?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How did Arrhenius contribute to the understanding of electrolytes,  acids, and bases?<br />

  <li>What role does energy have in the dissolving of a substance?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How can you predict the solubility of a substance in water?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How is dynamic equilibrium involved when studying a saturated  solution?<br />
    <br />

<h4>In This Module 4 </h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson 1&mdash;Classifying Matter and Solutions</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you hear  the term <em>solution</em>, you probably  visualize all the cleaning supplies in your home. While it&rsquo;s true these  products are solutions, there are many other items around your home that are  solutions as well! For example, a gold ring is a metal-metal solution called an  alloy. In this lesson you will learn how to properly classify matter and  solutions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is a solution?</li>
  <li>What kind of mixture is a solution?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 2&mdash;Dissolving Substances </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dissolving a  substance seems to be a very simple process when you observe it&mdash;simply throw a  suitable solid into water and it disappears. However, the theoretical reasons  for this process baffled scientists for centuries. In this lesson you will  learn how Svante Arrhenius contributed to solution chemistry with his theories  of electrolyte dissociation. You will also learn how bond energy plays a  critical role in the dissolving process, allowing for the existence of products  like cold packs and heat packs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>How did Arrhenius contribute to the understanding of electrolytes,  acids, and bases?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>What does it mean to dissolve a substance?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>What role does energy have in the dissolving of a substance?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 3&mdash;Solubility</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This lesson  discusses the qualitative aspects of solubility. Solutions are not capable of  holding an unlimited amount of solute. At some point the solute will simply  start collecting at the bottom of the container. There are many factors that  can affect the solubility of a solid or a gas in solution, and you will learn  about these factors both empirically and theoretically.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are saturated solutions?</li>
  <li>How can you predict the solubility of a substance in water?</li>
  <li>How is dynamic equilibrium involved when studying saturated  solutions?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 4&mdash;Concentration I </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Concentration  is a quantitative aspect of solution chemistry that provides a comparison of  the amount of solute to the amount of solution. There are many methods of  expressing concentration in consumer products, and you will learn how and why  these methods are used. You will also learn how concentration measurements are  used in a wide variety of applications.</p>
<ul>
  <li>How can the concentration of solute in a solution be expressed?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 5&mdash;Concentration II </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Concentration  must be expressed in a lab using moles rather than mass. Otherwise, mathematical  relationships between the entities in a balanced chemical equation cannot be  described in a straightforward manner. In this lesson you will learn how to  calculate amount concentrations in a variety of situations. You will then learn  how amount concentrations can be applied to dissociated ions, dilution, and  solution preparation.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>How can the concentration of solute in a solution be expressed?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How do you calculate amount concentration and determine  concentration of species in a solution?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How are solutions prepared  in a lab?</li>

<p>Do you know  where your drinking water comes from? Glacier meltwater in the Rocky Mountains  is the source of all rivers in Alberta.  The Bow River,  which flows through Calgary, starts at the Bow  Glacier in Banff National Park. The North Saskatchewan  River, which flows through Edmonton,  starts at the Saskatchewan Glacier in the Columbia Icefield.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both Calgary and Edmonton, as well as many other communities in Alberta, use river water as drinking water. However, before the river water arrives at  people&rsquo;s homes, it undergoes inspection and treatment to make sure it is  suitable for human consumption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you know  if your drinking water is safe? The <em>Guidelines  for Canadian Drinking Water Quality</em>, published by Health Canada, gives  maximum upper limits for the concentration of dangerous substances in the water  supply. All drinking water must meet specific requirements in the following  areas: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>    aesthetic quality (clarity and colour)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>microbiological and chemical contamination</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The inspection  and treatment of water is a very complex process, and it requires a thorough  understanding of solutions. In this lesson you will begin your study of  solutions by learning how scientists classify matter and solutions.</p>

</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Some religious and human rights organizations have expressed concern  about the &ldquo;privatization&rdquo; of water and feel it is unethical to repackage a  basic necessity of life  for profit. Opponents to this objection often refer to the fact that food and  shelter are just as vital, and since those items are sold as commodities, why  not water too? What is your opinion about selling water?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matter is a very general term  that refers to anything that has mass and occupies space. Scientists subdivide  matter into two broad categories: pure substances and mixtures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A pure substance consists of one  chemical only and may be subcategorized as either an element or a compound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A mixture consists of two or more  substances and may be subcategorized as either homogeneous or heterogeneous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A homogeneous mixture may  appear to contain only one substance with uniform properties, but in reality it  may contain several different substances. A solution is a type of homogeneous  mixture composed of at least one solute and one solvent. Can you think of any  other examples of homogeneous mixtures?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A heterogeneous mixture visibly  contains two or more different components. A chocolate chip cookie is a  heterogeneous mixture since the chocolate chips can be seen as being separate  from the rest of the cookie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more  information on the different forms of matter, read &ldquo;Classifying  Matter&rdquo; on pages 12 and 13 of your textbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>For more information on methods used to isolate the different components  of matter in a mixture, read &ldquo;Crystallization&rdquo; and  &ldquo;Filtration&rdquo; on pages 802 and 803 in your textbook. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Classification of Solutions</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="left1block">
  <p><img src="../../images/m4/003_metal_rings.jpg" alt="Two plain circular jewellery rings are shown. One ring is gold in colour and the other ring is grey." width="160" height="158" /></p>
</div>
<p>Metals such as  gold are called &ldquo;precious metals&rdquo; because they are rare in nature and have a  high economic value. Since ancient times, gold jewellery has been produced as a  means of displaying wealth and status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One problem with the use of gold for jewellery is the softness of the  metal. You may have seen a gold ring that has been worn so long that it is no  longer round because it has shaped itself to the finger of the person wearing  it. Gold in its pure form is actually too soft to use in jewellery&mdash;it can bend  out of shape very easily. Fortunately, the strength of most jewellery is  improved significantly by mixing the gold with other metals to form a solution  called an alloy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you wearing  a gold ring? Can you read the stamp on the inside of the band? You may have  noticed that the stamp indicated that the gold is 10 k or 14 k. When gold is  labelled as being 24 karat, it means 24 parts are pure gold and no other metal  is present. If gold is 18 karat, 18 parts of the 24 total possible parts are  gold and the 6 remaining parts are some other metal, which together forms the  alloy. A ring that is 24-karat gold will more easily bend out of shape than a  ring that is 18-, 14-, or 10-karat gold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only does  an alloy solution improve the strength of the jewellery, it can dramatically  change the appearance of the jewellery too! The only difference between yellow  gold and white gold is the type of metal being mixed with the gold. You will  soon understand how solution chemistry plays an important role in the production  of yellow gold and white gold rings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Definition  and Types of Solutions</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <strong>solution</strong> is composed of a <strong>solute</strong> dissolved in a <strong>solvent</strong>. Solutes and solvents may be  solids, liquids, or gases. The following table shows how various combinations  lead to different types of solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="left4blockC">
  <p><strong>solution: </strong>a homogeneous mixture  of at least one solute dissolved in a solvent</p>
  <p><br />
      <strong>solute:</strong> a component of a solution, the material that  dissolves in the solvent</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>solvent: </strong>a component of a solution,  the material in which the solute dissolves</p>

<p>The most  important property of a solution is homogeneity. This means that the solution  will have an identical composition throughout. If you use a micropipette to  analyze an extremely small sample of a solution, it will have exactly the same  composition as the larger mixture. Substances like milk and fog are not  considered to be solutions because they are heterogeneous mixtures. In a true  solution, the solute particles will not separate from the solvent on standing,  nor can they be filtered out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For further information, read &ldquo;Solutions and Mixtures&rdquo; on  pages 192 and 193 up to &quot;Properties of Aqueous Solutions&quot; in your textbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Aesthetic Qualities of Drinking Water</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you fill a  glass with tap water, there are expectations for what this water should be  like. You would not expect dirty or cloudy water; and if there were a bad  smell, you might feel the water is unsuitable for drinking. There are a number  of physical characteristics that must be inspected to make sure the water you  drink meets guidelines for aesthetic quality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Turbidity</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right1blockC">
  <p><strong>turbidity:</strong> the measure of the clarity of a clear  liquid</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Turbidity</strong> is a measure of the water cloudiness that  results from the suspension of small particles. In nature, water is  continuously picking up sediment and organic matter. While the particles  themselves may not pose a significant health risk, dangerous micro-organisms  can attach themselves to these particles. During water treatment the sediment  can actually protect the micro-organisms from disinfectant processes. If water  is sterilized using ultraviolet (or UV) light, a micro-organism shielded by the  sediment will not be destroyed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not all cloudy  water is associated with turbidity. For example, tap water is sometimes cloudy  when it first comes out of the tap, but clears up after it stands for a few  minutes. This is due to air that is trapped in the water from turbulence in the  pipes. This type of cloudiness has no health concerns associated with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Colour</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most people  expect their drinking water to be clear, but sometimes there are substances  present that give the water a tint. In Canada, 90% of the drinking water  comes from surface water, while the remaining 10% comes from groundwater. If  surface water has a colour, it likely results from organic substances of  natural origin. If groundwater has a colour, it likely results from dissolved  minerals. One of the main problems with coloured water is that it can stain  laundry and plumbing fixtures.</p>

    <td><p><strong>Humic Acid Discolouration.</strong>This discolouration can be caused by humic acid, which is present naturally  in soil and vegetation. At the current time, it is assumed this substance has  no significant effect on human health. Research is being done to see whether  the chlorination process reacts with humic acid to create toxic by-products or  whether the presence of humic acid correlates to the presence of heavy metals  in the drinking water.</p></td>

    <td><p><strong>Iron  Discolouration.</strong> Iron can naturally enter drinking water from soil and rocks or  from being leached out of pipes. In low doses iron is a nutrient required by  the body, so there is no significant health risk.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Reddish-brown water can also occur if rust-coloured sediments are disturbed  during water main repairs. This discolouration can often be remedied by letting the  tap run for several minutes.</p></td>

  <tr>
    <td><img src="../../images/m4/005_green_flask.jpg" alt="A diagram shows a half-filled beaker containing a blue solution." width="88" height="132" /></td>
    <td><p><strong>Copper  Discolouration.</strong> On rare occasions, specific conditions arise that allow copper to  be leached out of pipes into the drinking water. This is not typically a hazard  since copper in trace amounts is an essential nutrient. However, in older  homes, lead may have been used in some of the pipes.

      To keep water free of bacteria all the way to your tap, some chlorine must be    allowed to remain in the water. Occasionally, there may be enough chlorine    that an odour can be detected. This low quantity is non-toxic, and you may    drink the water. If the taste and smell of chlorine are not appealing you,    simply let the water stand and the chlorine will dissipate. </p></td>

    <td valign="top"><p><strong>Hydrogen    Sulfide Gas.</strong> This can occur in cases where tap water is coming from a well.    Decomposing deposits of underground organic matter produce this gas, which    may then enter the well water. Hydrogen sulfide gas can also enter well water    that is near coal deposits or oil fields.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In some    cases, the water itself is not the cause of the rotten-egg smell; rather it    is coming from the drain. Anaerobic bacteria can thrive in this environment,    producing hydrogen sulfide gas that accumulates underneath the food trap.    When the water is turned on, the gas is forced out of the drain, yielding the    rotten-egg smell. This problem can be fixed by pouring a cup of household    bleach down the drain to kill the bacteria.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>It is also possible that the    smell is coming from the hot water heater, which has a magnesium rod that can    interact with sulfates in the water to produce hydrogen sulfide gas. This is    likely the problem if the rotten-egg smell is present in hot water but not    cold water.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Hydrogen    sulfide gas is not harmful at the levels you would find in tap water, and the    bacteria that produce it pose no known health risk. However, if the smell is    indeed coming from the water and has appeared for no previously known reason,    it would be a good idea to call your water supplier to inform them of the    problem. Hydrogen sulfide gas can, in rare cases, result from pollution or    sewage contamination.</p>      </td>

<h6>The  Aqueous Phase</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you read in the previous  section, drinking water can contain many dissolved substances. Not only can  dissolved substances provide colour or taste, but they can make a solution have  other unique properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right1blockC">
  <p><strong>aqueous  phase: </strong>a phase denoting a  highly soluble substance that has been dissolved in water; denoted by (aq)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>conductivity: </strong>the ability of a  solution to transfer  an electric current</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>electrolyte:</strong> a solution that conducts an electric current</p>

<p>If sugar is  dissolved in water, can it still it be written as C<span class="subscript">12</span>H<span class="subscript">22</span>O<span class="subscript">11</span>(s)?  The answer to this question is no, since the sugar molecules are no longer  behaving as a crystalline solid&mdash;they are dispersed throughout the solution. The <strong>aqueous phase</strong> (aq) is used to  indicate that a substance is dissolved in water. Note that a solute is said to  be aqueous only if it is dissolved in water. If it is dissolved in a different  solvent, such as alcohol, the phase would be written (alc).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two other  properties often considered when investigating solutions are conductivity and  acidity. (Solubility is another property, which will be addressed in a later  lesson.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some  solutions demonstrate<strong> conductivity.</strong> A solution that conducts  electricity contains <strong>electrolytes</strong>.  Electrolytes are charged ions present within a solution. Their ability to move  allows a current to be established within a solution. Tap water conducts  electricity because the ions of dissolved solutes are present, while pure  distilled water would not conduct electricity since no ions are present. Many  molecular compounds form solutions that are <strong>nonelectrolytes </strong>because the solute does not form ions  when it dissolves. Therefore, solutions containing dissolved molecular  compounds do not conduct electricity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the beginning of this lesson, you were asked  the following essential questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is a solution?</li>
  <li>What kind of mixture is a solution?</li>
</ul>
<p>Many people  know that gold is a yellow metal, but they have no idea what white gold is.  People will often say that a white gold ring contains platinum! You have now  learned that white gold does indeed contain gold, but the gold is in an alloy  solution with other metals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before  completing this lesson, you likely thought the term <em>solution</em> was nothing more than another way of saying that  something is a liquid. As you have seen, solutions are far more varied and may  exist as solids, liquids, or gases. You also learned that solutions are defined  as homogeneous mixtures, preventing things like milk and fog from being  classified as solutions. Finally, the unique properties of solutions were  explored, and you learned how they can be used to distinguish visually  identical solutions from one another in the lab.</p>

</div>
<p>All organisms  require clean water in order to survive. Have you ever tried to keep tropical  fish? The chemistry of successfully maintaining an aquarium&mdash;especially a  saltwater aquarium&mdash;is underestimated by most people who have not had to  maintain one.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>To properly  manage an aquarium, you must test the water&rsquo;s composition of dissolved  substances. Some of these substances include</p>
<ul>
  <li>chlorine</li>
  <li>ammonia and nitrites</li>
  <li>phosphates</li>
  <li>oxygen</li>
  <li>salt (only in a saltwater aquarium)</li>
</ul>
<h6><a></a><strong>Water in the  Aquarium</strong></h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dissolved  substances play a tremendous role in aquarium water. Fish are living creatures  that are very sensitive to the concentrations of various chemicals. The following  is a list of chemicals that must be closely monitored for fish to survive in a  tank:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>chlorine:</strong> Even though the amount of chlorine in  tap water is very small, it can cause distress to fish. A chemical additive  called a dechlorinator must be added to tap water in order to remove the  chlorine.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>ammonia: </strong>Fish  are continuously producing ammonia in their waste. In a natural ecosystem, this  is not a problem because the fish are not confined. However, in an aquarium,  the buildup of ammonia is toxic to fish. Some of the symptoms fish exhibit upon  exposure to high levels of tank ammonia are<br />
    <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; loss of appetite<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; red streaking on fins or body<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; internal hemorrhaging and death<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Test kits can be purchased to test for excess amounts of ammonia. There are  also chemicals that can be added to the water to neutralize the ammonia.  However, the best way to solve this problem is with prevention, and an aquarium  can make use of natural organisms to help control excess ammonia dissolved in  the water. In general, ammonia poisoning in fish occurs most often in new  tanks, but it can happen in established tanks as well if too many fish are in  the tank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Converting Ammonia to Nitrate</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The nitrogen cycle in an aquarium is the biological/chemical process of  removing fish waste before it becomes toxic to the fish. When a new tank is  purchased, it should be &ldquo;cycled&rdquo; before adding fish. This process involves the  establishment of beneficial bacteria in the filter media that removes ammonia  by converting it into less harmful chemicals.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The three stages of the nitrogen cycle are as follows:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="right3block"><img src="../../images/m4/016_fish_tank.jpg" alt="A diagrammatic representation of the nitrogen cycle. Four major features are shown in the diagram: a fish, an aquatic plant, the aquarium water, and the decomposing plant and animal matter at the bottom of the tank. A large arrow labelled food points toward the fish. A large arrow points from the fish toward the bottom of the tank and a label ammonium in the water. A large arrow points from the decomposing matter toward the ammonium label. Small white arrow extends within the aquarium water part of the diagram. A branched arrow extends from the ammonium label to a second label titled nitrites. The second branch of this arrow is toward the aquatic plant. An arrow extend form the nitrite label to a third label, titled nitrates. An arrow extends from nitrates to the aquatic plant." width="445" height="282" /></div>
<p><strong>Stage 1:</strong> The concentration of ammonia present in the fish tank increases due to  fish waste and the decomposition of uneaten food. If a new tank is being  cycled, ammonia drops can be added in the absence of fish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <strong>Stage 2:</strong> Bacteria, called nitrosomonas, in the tank take up the ammonia, which undergoes a chemical  reaction that yields nitrite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stage 3:</strong> A different type of bacteria, called nitrobacter, converts the nitrite  into nitrate, which is relatively safe compared to ammonia and nitrite.  However, nitrate can become toxic over time if allowed to build up. Therefore,  it is necessary to change the water regularly to keep the nitrate levels within  an acceptable margin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A failure to  understand the chemistry behind aquarium water is the main reason people get  frustrated with keeping fish.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>oxygen: </strong>Fish need oxygen to survive. Even though  oxygen levels are usually kept at sufficient levels by normal tank procedures,  conditions may arise that could indicate the oxygen levels in a tank are  dropping to low levels. Some of the things to watch out for are<br />
      <br />
    &ndash; plants in the tank not receiving sufficient lighting<br />
    &ndash; too many fish in the tank <br />
    &ndash; greenish water<br />
    &ndash; high water temperature</li>
</ul>
<p>It is fairly easy to introduce more oxygen to the tank. Simply mixing the water  with your hand will draw air into the water and increase the oxygen content.
</p>
<ul>
      <li>      <strong>phosphorus: </strong>Phosphorus is a substance that can be initially present in tap water or  may enter the fish tank from the incorrect use of detergents. Phosphorus is a  nutrient that promotes algae outbreaks. The growth of algae is dangerous to fish  because competition will take place for the limited resources in the tank. It  is important to test the aquarium for phosphates to prevent algae growth. In  larger bodies of water phosphorous can also promote increased algae growth,  with a potential to damage the aquatic habitat. To further study this effect  you may wish to use the search terms <em>eutrophication</em>, <em>phosphorous</em>, and <em>bodies of water</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h6>Arrhenius&rsquo;s Theory of Electrolytes, Acids,  and Bases </h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2block">
  <p><img src="../../images/m4/009_Arrhenius.jpg" alt="A photograph of Svante Arrhenius" width="155" height="177" /></p>
  <p class="credit">&copy; 2007 Jupiterimages Corporation</p>
</div>
<p>In 1887, while  working on his PhD in chemistry, Svante Arrhenius did substantial research on  the freezing-point depression of solutions containing electrolytes. This  research led to the development of a unique theory to describe the changes that  occur to solutes when they dissolve in water. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read pages 197  through 199 in your textbook to learn about Arrhenius&rsquo;s theory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Understanding this theory requires you  to interpret the observable changes to a system in a new way,  and  to integrate what you have learned about intermolecular bonding  from your study in Unit A in this course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>Arrhenius's Theory</strong></h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results  from Arrhenius&rsquo;s research led him to say that ionic compounds <strong>dissociate</strong>, meaning they separate  into positive and negative ions. This was the first readily accepted  theoretical explanation for the conductivity of solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to  Arrhenius, electrolytes, such as sodium chloride, dissolve and dissociate.  Nonelectrolytes, such as sugar, dissolve but do not dissociate. This can be  shown with the following equations:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>electrolyte:</strong> NaCl(s) &rarr; Na<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq) + Cl<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq)<br />
  <br />
  <strong>nonelectrolyte:</strong> C<span class="subscript">12</span>H<span class="subscript">22</span>O<span class="subscript">11</span>(s)  &rarr; C<span class="subscript">12</span>H<span class="subscript">22</span>O<span class="subscript">11</span>(aq)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2blockB">
  <p><strong>Arrhenius acid: </strong>a substance that ionizes in water to produce hydrogen ions</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Arrhenius base:</strong> an ionic compound that  dissociates in water to produce hydroxide ions</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>dissociation:</strong> the separation of ions that  occurs when an ionic compound dissolves in water</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>ionization:</strong> a process by which a  neutral atom or molecule is converted to an ion; the reaction of substances in  water to create ions</p>
</div>
<p>Arrhenius also  developed a powerful theoretical explanation to explain acids and bases at the  molecular level. If an ionic compound  dissociates to yield hydroxide ions in solution, it&rsquo;s an <strong>Arrhenius base</strong>.  This theory accounts for why substances, such as NaOH(s) and Ba(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span>(s),  form basic solutions&mdash;they give off OH<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>  ions when dissolved in water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acids were more  difficult to explain because they contain covalent bonds rather than ionic  bonds. Nevertheless,&nbsp;if a substance<strong> ionizes</strong> to produce hydrogen ions in  solution, it&rsquo;s an <strong>Arrhenius acid</strong>.

  <p><img src="../../images/m4/010_kool_pack.jpg" alt="A photograph of two commercial cold packs." width="134" height="139" /></p>
</div>
<p>Have you or  someone you know ever sprained an ankle or wrist? Did it swell and change  colour? It was probably wrapped in a stretchy bandage and iced. When a tissue  injury occurs, such as a pulled muscle or a sprain, capillaries break and blood  leaks into the surrounding tissue. This leakage causes swelling to occur and  leads to significant pain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If cold is  applied to the injury immediately after it happens, the blood vessels constrict  and release less fluid. This change can minimize the pain associated with the  injury. The advantages of quickly reducing swelling to an injured area have  made cold packs a required item in most sports trainers' kits. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An unused cold pack is normally at room temperature and feels like a  plastic bag filled with water. However, when the cold pack is forcefully  squeezed, an inner package breaks and the contents are allowed to mix. The cold  pack becomes cold! By the end of this lesson, you will understand how a  theoretical understanding of solution chemistry can explain this surprising  result.</p>

  <p><strong>endothermic process:</strong> a change in matter    that requires an input of energy to occur</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>exothermic process: </strong>a change in matter    that releases energy when it occurs</p>
</div>
<p>Read the  section &ldquo;Energy Changes&rdquo; on pages 199 and 200 in your textbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you read in  the section of your textbook, several steps are involved when a solid dissolves  in water to form aqueous ions. The first two steps require energy to break  bonds and are <strong>endothermic</strong>.  An endothermic process absorbs energy from the surroundings, making the  surroundings cooler. The final step releases energy as bonds form and is <strong>exothermic</strong>. An exothermic process  is the opposite of an endothermic one, releasing energy into the surroundings  and warming the surroundings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following steps essentially happen simultaneously but are separated  for your understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<div class="right2block"><img src="../../images/m4/011_breaking_bonds.jpg" alt="A diagram shows alternating yellow and green spheres organized in three dimensions. The green spheres are labeled with a negative sign, and the yellow spheres are labeled with a plus sign. A water molecule represented by a single red sphere and two white spheres is beside one of the outer yellow spheres. Another water molecule is beside one of the outer green spheres. Red arrows point from each of the water molecules toward the yellow and green spheres. A label beside the arrow reads: Energy is required to break the ionic bonds holding the ions together." width="158" height="139" /></div>
<p><strong>Step 1: Breaking Bonds in</strong> <strong>the Solute (Endothermic)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ions in the solid are held together with ionic bonds. These bonds must be  broken before dissociation can occur. This step is endothermic because the  energy required to break the bond comes from polar interactions with water  molecules. (Think of the water molecule pulling the ion out from the solid.) As  the water molecules use up their energy to break this bond, the solution cools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2block"><img src="../../images/m4/012_breaking_bonds.jpg" alt="The diagram shows a single green sphere surrounded by many water molecules. At the other side of the diagram, a single yellow sphere is surrounded by water molecules. Attractive forces between particles are shown by dotted lines. Dotted lines are shown between one water molecule and the green sphere. Dotted lines are shown between one water molecule and the yellow sphere.  Dotted lines are shown between the other water molecules in the diagram. The dotted lines between the water molecules are labeled with  red arrows. The label on the arrows reads: Energy must be supplied to break hydrogen bonds between water molecules." width="137" height="135" /></div>
<p><strong>Step 2: Breaking Bonds in  the Solvent  (Endothermic)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The water molecules in the solution may be hydrogen bonded to other water  molecules. These hydrogen bonds must be broken before the water molecules can  be available for dissolving the ions from the solute. This step is also  endothermic, and the surrounding water cools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><br />
  </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2block"><img src="../../images/m4/013_breaking-bonds.jpg" alt="The diagram shows a single green sphere surrounded by many water molecules. Dotted lines are shown between the yellow sphere and the water molecules.  At the other side of the diagram, a single yellow sphere is surrounded by water molecules. The diagram label reads: Energy is finally released when bonds form between the ions and water molecules." width="136" height="123" /></div>
<p><strong>Step 3:  Dissolving the Solute (Exothermic)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Now that the ions are in solution and sufficient water molecules are  free, bonds form between the water molecules and the ions. This step is  exothermic and releases energy, warming the surrounding water.<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you have  just learned, the dissolving process involves both endothermic and exothermic  processes. The overall energy of dissolving a solid can be determined using the  following formula:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>energy released  to break bonds in solute<br />
  + energy required to break bonds in solvent<br />
  &ndash; energy required to form bonds between solute and solvent<br />
  ______________________________________________________ <br />
  = total change  in energy<br />
  <br />
  Based on this  formula, if the energy required is more than the energy released, there is an  energy deficit and the solution will cool down. If the energy required is less  than the energy released, there is an energy surplus and the solution will warm  up. In Chemistry 20 you will not be able to predict whether dissolving an ionic  compound is an endothermic or exothermic process. The only way you can tell,  for now, is by dissolving each substance in water and measuring the change in  temperature. In Chemistry 30 you will learn how to use mathematics to predict  the energy released.</p>

</div>
<p>Dr. David  Schindler is an internationally renowned ecologist at the University of Alberta.  He has conducted extensive research on how human activities can damage  freshwater reserves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the environmental problems we face today, fresh water is  probably the most important. Our lakes and streams are Mother Nature&rsquo;s sewers,  and the water tends to reflect everything we do. There exists here a myth of  abundance with regard to fresh water. We are told that Canada has more  fresh water than any other country. In fact, there is a lack of fresh water  available to the most populated parts of Canada, and most fresh water is in  the north or flowing towards the north. Alberta,  in particular, has a water deficit: evaporation is greater than precipitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the late 1960s, Dr.  Schindler conducted research in the ELA (Experimental Lakes Area), a set of 58  lakes in the Precambrian Shield of northwestern Ontario. This set of lakes is reserved for  large-scale experiments of ecosystem stressors. One of Dr. Schindler&rsquo;s main  contributions to ecology was his research on the effect of phosphorus-based  fertilizers and detergents on lakes. Dr. Schindler helped show that not all  nutrients dissolved in water are necessarily beneficial&mdash;they can have  unforeseen consequences when imposed on delicate ecosystems.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SC 9.</strong> Dissolving occurs when  the molecules of a liquid surround the solute, resulting in dissociation,  ionization, or dispersion. Dissolving a substance is a physical change since no  new substances are produced.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SC 10.</strong> An endothermic process  draws energy from the surroundings. An observation of many endothermic changes  is a reduction in the temperature of the system or matter being investigated.  For example, water evaporation is endothermic. Your skin feels colder when  water evaporates because energy is drawn from your skin to fuel the  evaporation.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>An exothermic  process releases energy to the surroundings, increasing the temperature. For  example, the chemical reaction in a heat pack is exothermic. The surplus energy  warms up the solution and the heat pack feels hot.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SC 11.</strong> No. The act of  dissolving always requires energy to dissociate, ionize, or disperse a  substance.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <strong>SC 12. </strong>Water  molecules do not simply float around in isolation; they are closely packed with  other water molecules and experience intermolecular forces. Before a group of  water molecules can come together to surround and dissolve a solute, they must  first break free from the hydrogen bonds with adjacent water molecules.  Therefore hydrogen bonds between water molecules can be considered to have  attractive forces between them, some of which must be overcome in order for  associations to occur between water molecules and the solute particles. Given  the large number of water molecules involved in this process, the energy can be  significant even though it is typically far less than the energy required to  break the ionic bond.</div>

<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Lesson Summary </h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson you explored the following essential  questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How did Arrhenius contribute to the understanding of electrolytes,  acids, and bases?</li>
  <li>What does it mean to dissolve a substance?</li>
  <li>What role does energy have in the dissolving of a solid?</li>
</ul>
<p>Dissolving a  solute might seem quite simple, but as you have learned from your work in this  lesson, many events at the molecular level are involved with this process.  Imagine for a moment what life would be like if dissociation and intermolecular  forces did not exist. Without dissociation, a beaker of water could not  dissolve ionic solids&mdash;they would simply accumulate at the bottom. Without  intermolecular forces, sugars could not dissolve, and you would be deprived of  an energy source required for survival.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Now that you have learned about the many chemical events required to  dissolve a solid, you can appreciate how complex processes at the molecular  level can result in simplicity at the macroscopic level. While billions of  bonds are being broken and formed in the endothermic process of dissolving  ammonium chloride in a cold pack, you get to simply squeeze the bag, shake, and  apply.

<p>Have you ever  had a shower that left you feeling like you weren&rsquo;t able to wash all the soap  off your body?&nbsp; Tap water, especially in Alberta is often &ldquo;hard&rdquo;  due to the presence of calcium and magnesium dissolved in the water. While hard  water is safe to drink, there are problems associated with its use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minerals  found in hard water have a tendency to form limescale deposits in household  pipes, reducing the flow of water. Also, kitchen and bathroom fixtures that  regularly use tap water may build up soap scum due to the fact that calcium  and magnesium can react with detergents to form a residue that is difficult to  rinse away. You may wish to view some examples of problems caused by hard water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Different Types of Hard-Water Buildup</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Calcium is  present in tap water in the form of calcium carbonate. Even though calcium  carbonate is generally insoluble in water, the concentration is so low that it  remains dissolved in solution. Depending on the context, hard-water buildup can  arise in different ways: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>hot-water buildup </strong>(found in pipes, kitchen  appliances, bathroom fixtures, etc.) <br />
    Calcium carbonate is a unique ionic solid&mdash;it becomes <em>less</em> soluble when the water temperature  increases! Consider boiling hard water in a pot on the stove. As the water  heats up and reaches a boil, calcium carbonate precipitates out of the  solution, forming a residue on the bottom and sides of the pot. This is similar  to the hard-water buildup that occurs in pipes and other fixtures that use hot  water.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>soap scum </strong>(found on dishes, shower  curtains, etc.) <br />
    Soaps contain organic acids that react with magnesium and calcium in hard water  to form an insoluble salt. This can result in the residue commonly found on  dishes and shower curtains.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li><strong>evaporation </strong>(found on surfaces where  hard water evaporates)<br />
    When hard water evaporates, all dissolved solutes will be left behind as the  water dries up. If you have ever cleaned a glass table top with tap water (and  no other cleaning agents), you have likely observed the spots associated with  hard-water evaporation.<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Do you have a pot or fixture that has hard-water buildup? It is easy to  remove hard-water calcium deposits using an acid solution, such as vinegar. If  the buildup is on a flat surface, cover the surface with vinegar for several  minutes and the buildup will dissolve. If the surface is upright, you could  scrub the surface with a paper towel soaked in vinegar. Commercial products are  also available for this process and can usually do the job more quickly.

<p>Fill a cup with  approximately 100 mL of lukewarm water. Add a teaspoon of salt, stirring until  all of the salt has dissolved. Repeat this procedure until you notice salt on  the bottom that does not dissolve, no matter how much you stir.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you are  observing is an example of a saturated salt solution. You were probably able to  get 5 teaspoons to dissolve, but the sixth one would not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now pour the  solution into another glass, making sure none of the undissolved salt is  transferred. Put this glass in your freezer for about half an hour, and then  observe it. Record your observations. Allow the cooled salt water from the  freezer to sit at room temperature. Record any changes that occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you explain  the changes that occurred with the salt water as you cooled it and allowed it  to warm?</p>

<h6>Saturated Solutions</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2blockC">
  <p><strong>saturated solution:</strong> a solution that contains  the maximum quantity of solute for a specified temperature; in which no more  solute will dissolve at a specified temperature; at maximum solute concentration</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>solubility:</strong> the concentration of a  saturated solution at a specified temperature</p>
</div>
<p>In the Try This  activity in the previous page you observed a <strong>saturated</strong> <strong>solution</strong> undergoing change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a  limit to how much solute can be dissolved in a solvent. You may notice this  when you pour sugar into tea or coffee. If you pour in too much, the sugar will  simply sit at the bottom of the cup. The following illustration shows what  happens when maximum solubility is reached.<br />
  &nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>solubility</strong> of NaCl(s) in water at 20 &deg;C is 36 g/100 mL. What that means is only 36 g of  solute may be absorbed by 100 mL of water at this temperature. </p>

<h6>Hard Water vs. Soft Water</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the  introduction to this lesson, you learned about some of the problems associated  with hard water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is soft  water, and how does a water softener work? Soft water is free of calcium and  magnesium ions. A water softener works because of the presence of an  ion-exchange resin, which is typically found in the water filter as small  beads. The ion-exchange resin functions by removing magnesium and calcium ions  from the water in a process that exchanges them for sodium ions. In other  words, the price you pay for getting soft water is that the water becomes  salty.</p>
<p>Some of the  benefits of using soft water in the home include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Soap lathers more readily and does not leave a residue (soap  scum).</li>
  <li>Laundry is brighter and can endure more washings before fading.</li>
  <li>Pipes do not develop buildup, and hot water tanks last longer.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the  negative issues include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Calcium and magnesium are required by the body, and the  water-softening process removes these valuable minerals.<br />
  </li>
  <li>The characteristic taste of water is caused by the presence of  minerals. Removing the minerals makes the water taste different. Some people  may like the taste, but that is a matter of preference.</li>
</ul>
<p>The process of softening water increases the sodium content of water.  This results in the water being slightly salty.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <strong>SC 1.</strong> Solids dissolve better in warm solutions because the water molecules have more  energy to break bonds holding the solid together. Gases dissolve worse in warm  solutions because the gas molecules have more energy and move faster, escaping  the solution.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SC 2.</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>All 170 g will dissolve.</li>
      <li>All 180 g will dissolve.</li>
      <li>Only 180 g will dissolve. 10 g will remain undissolved.</li>
      <li>First, determine the maximum amount of solute that can dissolve. If 100  mL can hold 180 g, then 300 mL can hold 540 g. If 600 g of sucrose is placed in  the solution, only 540 g will dissolve. The other 60 g will remain undissolved. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>SC 3.</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>All 0.002 g will dissolve.</li>
      <li>All 0.003 g will dissolve.</li>
      <li>Only 0.003 g will dissolve. 0.001 g will escape the solution.</li>
      <li>First, determine the maximum amount of solute that can dissolve. If 100  mL can hold 0.003 g, then 400 mL can hold 0.012 g. If 0.010 g of nitrogen is  placed in the solution, all of it will dissolve. <br />
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>SC 4.</strong> The term <em>solubility</em> refers quantitatively to the  maximum amount of solute that can be dissolved in water. It can be expressed as  a number with units of g/mL (or mol/L). A saturated solution is a qualitative  term describing a solution that will not dissolve any more solute at a given  temperature.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The two terms  may be used in a sentence as follows:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A saturated  solution of sucrose has a solubility of 487 g/100 mL at 100 &ordm;C.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>SC 5.</strong> Three ways you could  turn this solution into a saturated solution are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You could add more NaCl(s) until the solution is saturated.</li>
      <li>You could cool the solution to reduce the solubility.</li>
      <li>You could allow water to evaporate from the solution.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>SC 6.</strong> At warmer temperatures,  both the detergent and stain substances will have a higher solubility in water.  Also, with the increase in temperature, the rate of chemical reactions  increases.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <strong>SC 7.</strong> Substance B is likely a gas because the solubility decreases as temperature  increases.</div>

<h6>Understanding the Solubility Table </h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most important tools you will use while doing chemistry is a  solubility table. A solubility table is used to determine the state of an ionic  substance when it is placed in water. Copies of this table are also located  inside the back cover of your textbook and in the <em>Chemistry Data Book</em>.</p>

<p>You may wonder  why the solubility table says &ldquo;very soluble&rdquo; and &ldquo;slightly soluble&rdquo; instead of  simply saying a solution is aqueous or solid. The reason these phrases are used  is because all substances dissolve to some extent, so even a relatively  insoluble compound, like CaCO<span class="subscript">3</span>(s),  may have a few errant ions in solution. However, for the sake of simplicity,  you are allowed to use the aqueous state (aq) for &ldquo;very soluble&rdquo; and the solid  state (s) for &ldquo;slightly soluble&rdquo; because the vast majority of entities will  exist in these states.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  1:</strong> Determine the state of calcium carbonate in water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, locate  the carbonate ion in the top row, and then locate the calcium ion underneath.  Since the calcium ion is not listed as one of the ions in the &quot;very  soluble&quot; section, it must be in the &ldquo;most&rdquo; category.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Calcium  carbonate has low solubility in water, so it can be written CaCO<span class="subscript">3</span>(s).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  2: </strong>Determine  the state of barium hydroxide in water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, locate  the hydroxide ion in the top row, and then locate the barium ion underneath.  Barium hydroxide has high solubility in water, so it can be written Ba(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span>(aq).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the  solubility table provides a lot of useful information, it is limited to  predicting the state of ionic solids in water. Since you will need to predict the  states of many other substances in water, you should memorize the following  rules and apply them when you write dissociation equations:<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Elements have low solubility in water. For example, a copper wire  in water would be Cu(s) and nitrogen gas bubbled through water is N<span class="subscript">2</span>(g).<br />
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Liquid water is always written H<span class="subscript">2</span>O(l). It is never  written H<span class="subscript">2</span>O(aq) because water cannot dissolve in itself.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>All ions are soluble and written with the state (aq).<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Polar molecules will dissolve in water to become aqueous solutions.  Nonpolar molecules do not dissolve in water and retain their original state.<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Now work through the following examples to put these four rules into use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
<p><strong>Example  3:</strong> Determine the state of ethanol, C<span class="subscript">2</span>H<span class="subscript">5</span>OH(l), in water.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Ethanol is a  polar molecule, so it will dissolve in water to become C<span class="subscript">2</span>H<span class="subscript">5</span>OH(aq).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Example  4:</strong> Determine the state of octane, C<span class="subscript">8</span>H<span class="subscript">18</span>(l), in water.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Octane is a  nonpolar molecule and does not dissolve. It stays as C<span class="subscript">8</span>H<span class="subscript">18</span>(l).</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Example  5:</strong> State the major entities present when Sr(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span>(s) is placed in water.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>According to  the solubility chart, Sr(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span>(s) is highly soluble, so it will  dissociate. The major entities present in water will be Sr<span class="superscript">2+</span>(aq), OH<span class="superscript">&ndash;</span>(aq), and  H<span class="subscript">2</span>O(l). When you are asked to state the major entities present,  coefficients are not required and water should be included in the list since  solvent molecules also count.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Example  6:</strong> Write the balanced dissociation equation for sodium sulfate.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>According to  the solubility chart, Na<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>(s) is soluble in water, so  the balanced dissociation equation is</p>
Na<span class="subscript">2</span>SO<span class="subscript">4</span>(s) &rarr; 2 Na<span class="superscript">+</span>(aq) + SO<span class="subscript">4</span><span class="superscript">2&ndash;</span>(aq).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
When you are asked to write a dissociation equation, coefficients are required.  However, water does not need to be written in a dissociation equation since it  is assumed to be present on both sides.

<h6>Dynamic Equilibrium</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the  beginning of this lesson you completed a Try This exercise where you made  observations and wrote explanations about what was occurring within a saturated  solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right1blockC">
  <p><strong>dynamic equilibrium</strong>: the idea that there is a  balance between two opposing processes (forward and reverse) occurring at the  same rate</p>
</div>
<p>When the  solution was cooled, you observed that salt crystals were seen on the bottom of  the beaker. While it may appear the salt crystals are no longer dissolving,  they actually are. The amount of solid appears to remain constant because even  though some of the solid is dissolving, an equal amount of solid is crystallizing  out of the solution. This process is called <strong>dynamic equilibrium</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read the  section &ldquo;Explaining Saturated Solutions&rdquo; on pages 224 to 226 in your textbook. Pay  close attention to the description of the experimental evidence that was used  to test the theory of dynamic equilibrium described on pages 225 and 226.</p>
<h6>&nbsp;</h6>
<p>How does the figure below demonstrate the dynamic equilibrium in the  saturated solution of salt water you observed earlier in this lesson?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="left2block"><img src="../../images/m4/022_dynamic_equilibrium.jpg" alt="A diagram shows an ionic crystal as alternating green and orange spheres arranged in three dimensions. The green spheres are labeled with a minus sign. The orange spheres are labeled with a plus sign. In the upper left corner an orange sphere is shown leaving the crystal. In the upper right corner a green sphere is shown leaving the crystal. In the bottom right corner an orange sphere is shown joining the crystal. In the bottom left corner a green sphere is shown joining the crystal." width="169" height="148" /></div>
<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the dynamic equilibrium  involving a salt crystal in a saturated solution, there is still dissociating,  but the ions that leave are immediately replaced by other ions that enter the  solid from the solution. This process is similar to having a party for 20  people&mdash;if two new guests arrive and two people leave, the total number of  people present at the party remains the same. </p>

    <h6><img src="../icons/self_check.gif" width="35" height="31" align="bottom" /> Self-Check Answers</h6>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SC 11.</strong> Two opposing processes  must be occurring at exactly the same rate. The solution must be in a closed  system (the volume of water is constant, the amount of solute is constant, the  temperature is constant, etc.).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SC 12.</strong> No. Dynamic equilibrium  means two opposing processes must be occurring at exactly the same rate. When  the salt is being poured in, it is dissolving at a far greater rate than it is  crystallizing.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SC 13.</strong> A salt crystal is both  dissolving and crystallizing at the same rate. As such, the mass of the crystal  remains constant, even though it is constantly being broken and reformed.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SC 14.</strong> Create a saturated  solution of strontium chloride with some undissolved solute visible at the  bottom. Add a few drops of radioactive strontium chloride; then measure where  the radiation is coming from within the solution. After time passes, if  radiation is coming from within the solid, that means the radioactive sample  has crystallized into the solid.</p>

<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Lesson Summary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In this lesson you explored the following essential  questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>What are saturated solutions?</li>
  <li>How can you predict the solubility of a substance in water?</li>
  <li>How is dynamic equilibrium involved when studying saturated  solutions?</li>
</ul>
<p>In this lesson  you learned that solubility is an important aspect of solution chemistry. The solubility  of a substance is directly linked to the temperature of the solution, and in  the case of gases, external pressure can be a major solubility factor as well.  Solubility rules can be used to successfully predict the states of elements and  compounds in water. Finally, you learned about dynamic equilibrium, a  theoretical explanation of what is happening in a saturated solution at the  molecular level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first three  lessons of this unit focused exclusively on qualitative aspects of solution  chemistry. In Lessons 4 and 5, you will investigate the quantitative aspects of  solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson Glossary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dynamic equilibrium:</strong> the idea that there is a  balance between two opposing processes (forward and reverse) occurring at the  same rate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>immiscible:</strong> a term used to describe  liquids that do not dissolve in each other</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>saturated solution:</strong> a solution that contains  the maximum quantity of solute for a specified temperature; in which no more  solute will dissolve at a specified temperature; at maximum solute concentration</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>solubility:</strong> the concentration of a  saturated solution at a specified temperature</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that you  have considered where your drinking water comes from, how do you know if it is  really safe to drink? Does it come from a well or a reservoir? How is it  treated before it gets to your home? Who is accountable if something goes wrong  with your tap water? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Various government agencies set safety standards that water treatment  plants must adhere to. Since it is nearly impossible to remove all dissolved  substances from a solution, maximum allowable concentrations are in place to  protect those who drink the water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson  you will learn how concentration can be expressed using a variety of units. You  will then use this knowledge to gain a better understanding of the chemistry  associated with water quality.</p>

<p>Many terms are  used to describe the concentration of a solution. A powdered drink mix added to  a large quantity of water is called a dilute solution, whereas a powdered drink  mix added to a small quantity of water is considered to be a concentrated  solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Dilute</em> and <em>concentrated</em> are qualitative terms that  only have meaning in the context of comparing similar solutions. Saying a  solution is dilute provides no information about the specific quantities of  solute and solvent.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<div class="right1blockC"><strong>concentration: </strong>a property of solutions; the mass, volume, or number of moles of solute present in proportion to the quantity of solvent or total solution</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Concentration</strong> is defined as the ratio of the quantities of solute to the total  solution. This ratio can be written in a variety of ways. As you progress  through your exploration of solution chemistry, you will encounter  concentrations in many different forms. These forms of showing concentration  will be important when you study the maximum allowable concentrations of  contaminants in drinking water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Percentage Concentrations</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next time  you pick up a container, look at the label. Chances are that the liquid inside  is a solution, and the label will express the concentration of a component.  What might surprise you is that a variety of means to express concentration is  used. In this section you will learn about the most common methods for  expressing the concentration for commercial and other purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Percentage  Volume per Volume (% V/V)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read and  carefully work through &ldquo;COMMUNICATION example 1&rdquo; on page 203 in your textbook.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you have  completed your reading, work through the following example, followed by the  Self-Check problems below.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> 40 mL of  hydrogen peroxide is poured into 150 mL of water. Determine the % V/V  concentration of this solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This question  is different since the water volume is given instead of the total solution  volume. It&rsquo;s easy to get the solution volume. It is 40 mL + 150 mL = 190 mL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Now, divide the volume of hydrogen peroxide by the total volume of the  solution.

<p>A percentage  weight per volume (% W/V) concentration expresses the mass of solute as a  percentage of total solution volume. Breathalyzers use % W/V percentages to  indicate the alcohol content in blood. If a breathalyzer gives a reading of  0.05% W/V, it means 0.05 g of alcohol is present for every 100 mL of blood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A percentage weight per  weight (% W/W) concentration expresses the mass of a substance as a percentage  of total mass. % W/W concentrations may be used in many different contexts,  including mixtures that are not true solutions. For example, toothpaste may  read sodium monofluorophosphate (0.76% W/W). This means that 0.76 g of sodium  monofluorophosphate is found in every 100 g of toothpaste.</p>

<h6>Parts per Million Concentrations</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2block">
  <p><img src="../../images/m4/027_bathtub.jpg" alt="A photograph of a bathtub." width="166" height="110" /></p>
  <p class="credit">&copy; Nikola Hristovski/shutterstock</p>
</div>
<p>Sometimes the  concentration of solute in a solution is very small. To communicate the  concentration of such solutions, parts per million or even smaller concentrations are used. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have heard reports on climate change often refer to the ppm  concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. A part per million may be  thought of as one drop of water in a bathtub full of water or as 1 second every  11.6 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read &rdquo;Parts per  Million Concentration&rdquo; and &ldquo;COMMUNICATION example 3&rdquo; on pages 204 and 205 in your  textbook. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts per  million, as the name suggests, requires that the mass of solute be a million  times less than the mass of solution. For that reason, the units expressing  solute are typically milligrams (mg), whereas the units expressing solvent are  typically kilograms (kg). This leads to a ppm concentration in mg/kg. Water is  a unique solvent in that 1 L has a mass of 1 kg. As such, ppm concentrations in  water can be expressed as mg/L instead of mg/kg. In this course you can always  assume that water is the solvent unless specifically told otherwise. The  following summarizes the three main ways you can approach ppm calculations: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="left3block"><img src="../../images/m4/028_equation_box.jpg" alt="Equivalent fractions for calculating parts per million concentration are shown. Milligrams of solute per kilogram of solution, milligrams of solute per litre of solution, and grams of solute per grams of solution all multiplied by 10 exponent 6." width="325" height="93" /></div>
<p><br />
  <br />
</p>
<p>This example  shows how to convert one means of expressing concentration to another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  3:</strong> Express 38 ppm as a % W/W concentration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, convert  from ppm into mg/kg.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/m4/m4_equations/Eqn003.gif" width="122" height="40" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, express  the numerator and denominator with the same unit. This is required for % W/W  concentration calculations. In this example, convert the denominator from  kilograms into milligrams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/m4/m4_equations/Eqn004.gif" width="166" height="40" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, divide  and express a % W/W concentration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/m4/m4_equations/Eqn005.gif" width="288" height="40" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h6>Parts per Billion</h6>

 <div class="right3block">

   <p class="credit">&copy; J. Helgason/shutterstock</p>
 </div>
 <p>Units of parts per billion  are used for solutes that are extremely dilute. The mathematical rules for ppb  concentrations are very similar to ppm concentrations&mdash;the only difference is  that the mass of solutes is a billion times less than the mass of solution. The  mass of solute is so small that it is measured  in micrograms (<em>&mu;</em>g). The <em>&mu;</em> that you see is the Greek letter <em>mu</em>, and a microgram is one millionth of a  gram. Recall that a milligram is <span class="nowrap">one-thousandth</span> of a gram. A part per billion  may be thought of as one drop of water in a full swimming pool or as 1 second  every 32 years.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Work through  the following examples to practise calculations involving ppb concentration.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Example  4:</strong> 150 <em>&mu;</em>g of lithium bromide is  dissolved in water to make a 25-L solution. Express the concentration in ppb.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><img src="../../images/m4/m4_equations/Eqn108.gif" alt="" width="185" height="37" /></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The units of  the solute are in micrograms (<em>&mu;</em>g),  so no conversion is required. The units of water are in litres (L), so no  conversion is required.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Example  5:</strong> 3.7 mg of sodium chloride is dissolved in water to make a 115-g solution.  Express the concentration in ppb.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The units of the solute are in milligrams, so convert milligrams (mg)  into micrograms (<em>&mu;</em>g). The units  of water are in grams, so convert grams (g) into kilograms (kg).</p>

<p>Now that you  have an understanding of the regulations protecting your drinking water from  harmful levels of contaminants, it is time to consider how contaminants affect  the rest of the water system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The water in  rivers and lakes is a necessity of life for many organisms, including those at  the bottom of the food chain. The term <em>plankton</em> refers to marine and freshwater organisms that live in water and serve as food  for larger animals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If plankton live in water contaminated with mercury, plankton will  accumulate the toxin over time. Fish consume a large amount of plankton and, in  doing so, accumulate the mercury stored in the plankton. This process continues  all the way up the food chain and presents a significant health concern for  higher-order mammals, including humans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process  described here is called biomagnification, and it is a serious environmental  concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Canada&rsquo;s  North, the traditional Inuit way of life is threatened because the food supply contains  dangerous levels of mercury. In this lesson you will learn how some of the  products in your home pollute the water supply and contribute to  biomagnification.</p>

<p>Historically, people believed that diluting any type of substance renders it  permanently harmless. A foul odour that dissipates no longer smells bad, and  red food dye poured into a vast body of water will eventually vanish. But do  these substances really disappear? Use relevant chemical concepts to explain  how the dilution of a substance is not a way to treat pollution.<br />
  <br />
  If &ldquo;The solution to pollution is NOT dilution,&rdquo; then what processes can be used  to treat waste? Consider what you have learned in this lesson about dissolving,  solubility, and solutions. Is it a good strategy to dilute solutions containing  harmful substances? &nbsp;</p>

<p>In Lesson 4 you  learned to express concentration  as % V/V, % W/V, % W/W, in parts per  million, and in parts per  billion. While labels like percentage weight per volume are great for consumer  products, and parts per million is often used for environmental work, chemists  in a lab typically express concentration using another set of units. In a  previous science course you learned about the mole, the chemical quantity used  to express matter. Do you remember what a &ldquo;mole&rdquo; is? Later, in Modules 5 and 6,  you will see that expressing quantities of substances using moles is favoured  because these values can be used to predict quantities of other substances  involved in a chemical reaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To review your  understanding of the mole, read page 51 in your textbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2blockC"><strong>amount concentration:</strong> the proportion of solute (in moles) to volume of solution</div>
<p>In this lesson you will learn how to calculate <strong>amount </strong><strong>concentration</strong>. You will also learn  how amount concentration can be applied to a wide variety of situations, such  as dilution and solution preparation in a lab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Amount Concentration</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amount  concentration expresses the solute in number of <strong>moles</strong> and the volume in <strong>litres</strong>. In many cases, you will have to convert a given  mass into a number of moles before finding the amount concentration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="left4block"><img src="../../images/m4/038_equation_box.jpg" alt="Two formulas are shown. The one on the left is the formula to calculate moles.

  <p class="credit"><img src="../../images/m4/041_pills.jpg" alt="A photograph of multicoloured antacid tablets on a table next to an open pill container." width="210" height="142" /></p>
  <p class="credit">&copy; Linda Muir/shutterstock</p>
</div>
<p>Many solutions found in a  lab are not actually bought as solutions but as solutes&mdash;the solutions are made  in the lab by dissolving the solute in water. This procedure greatly reduces  the transportation costs of bringing chemical solutions to the end user. A  bottle of antacid tablets is economical since you can make 100 antacid  solutions from an initial purchase of five dollars. If these 100 solutions all  had to be bought separately as solutions, they would cost hundreds of dollars! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Preparing  solutions requires the use of specialized glassware. Using appropriate  glassware allows for the preparation of solutions with precise concentrations.  Here are some of the specialized glassware you will use in preparing solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><br />
Volumetric  Flask</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2block">
  <p><img src="../../images/m4/042_flask.jpg" alt="A photograph of a volumetric flask. The bottom of the flask has a bulb shape and the flask has a long neck with a white graduation line along its length." width="86" height="109" /></p>
</div>
<p>Volumetric containers are used to measure a specific volume with a very  high degree of precision. For example, a 100-mL volumetric flask has a white  line that indicates 100 mL. The line is specific for each flask, and its  location was determined at standard temperature. This calibration process makes  volumetric flasks some of the most precise equipment in a chemistry lab. <br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Volumetric  Pipette</strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2block">
  <p><img src="../../images/m4/043_pipette.jpg" alt="A volumetric pipette and bulb. The pipette is a long thin glass tube with an oval bulge in its middle. The bulb is a compressible rubber object with a plastic cap to fit over the end of the pipette." width="122" height="94" /></p>
</div>
<p>A volumetric pipette is also a calibrated piece of glassware, but it is  used for lower volumes. Look at the pipettes in Figures 12 and 13 on the bottom  of <span class="nowrap">page 800</span> of your textbook. A 10-mL volumetric pipette has only one line  indicating precisely 10&nbsp;mL. Graduated pipettes may have markings for each  0.1 mL. See the graduated pipette at the bottom of the page in <span class="nowrap">Figure 13.</span></p>

  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Calculate the mass of  solute required.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/m4/m4_equations/Eqn043.gif" width="680" height="185" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>First, determine the number  of moles of FeSO<span class="subscript">4</span> &bull; 7H<span class="subscript">2</span>O(s) required.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../../images/m4/m4_equations/Eqn044.gif" width="230" height="101" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now, calculate  mass of solute required.</p>

<h6>Preparing a Solution by Dilution</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2blockC"><strong>stock solution:</strong> a concentrated solution that is used in the preparation of more dilute solutions of the same solute</div>
<p>Many labs prepare <strong>s</strong><strong>tock solutions</strong> of a specific  chemical. Stock solutions are often used to create new, less concentrated  solutions of the same solute by dilution, usually with water. A procedure for  preparing a standard solution by dilution appears in &quot;Preparing a Standard  Solution by Dilution&quot; on <span class="nowrap">pages 803</span> and 804 of your textbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To view the following video, click the link on Module 4 Lesson 5 Page 7 on your DVD.</p>
<p>If you have access to the internet, view the following Solution by Dilution <a href="http://www.nelson.com/ABchem20-30/student/protect/documents/solution_by_dilution.mov" target="_blank">video</a> which shows the process of using the lab equipment to dilute a solution.&nbsp; Your Username is <strong>nelsonchem_student</strong> and your password is <strong>nelsonchem_onlinelearning</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right2block"><img src="../../images/m4/044_flasks.jpg" alt="Dilution formula representation. Left-hand side of equation: lower case c subscript lower case I multiplied to upper case V subscript lower case i. Below this half of the equation is a beaker containing a small volume of solution with an intense grey colour. The right hand side of the equation is lower case c subscript lowercase f multiplied by uppercase V subscript lower case f. Below the right-hand side of the equation is a beaker containing a larger volume of solution, but with a less intense shade of grey." width="180" height="133" /></div>
<p>Dilution is the  process of increasing the amount of solvent, resulting in a less concentrated  solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read  &ldquo;Preparation of Standard Solutions by Dilution&rdquo; on pages 216 and 217 in your  textbook.&nbsp; Work through the two &quot;<strong><em>COMMUNICATION</em></strong>&quot; examples as you will be answering similar questions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What quantities  of a solution change when it is diluted? Which quantities do not change?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dilution  formula c<span class="subscript">i</span>V<span class="subscript">i</span> = c<span class="subscript">f</span>V<span class="subscript">f</span>,  is a convenient way to calculate changes that will occur when a dilution is  performed. The variables in this equation are</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>c</em><span class="subscript">i</span> = initial concentration of  solution</p>
  <p><em>V</em><span class="subscript">i</span> = initial volume  of solution</p>
  <p><em>c</em><span class="subscript">f</span> = final concentration of  solution</p>
  <p><em>V</em><span class="subscript">f</span>= final volume of  solution</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is the  dilution formula expressed as an equality? What chemical quantity is equal to  both sides of the equation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now work  through the following example problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  5:</strong> Calculate the volume of water necessary to dilute 50 mL of a 0.50-mol/L sodium  chloride solution to 0.30 mol/L.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="left1block"><img src="../../images/m4/m4_equations/Eqn046.gif" width="120" height="94" /></div>
<div class="left2block"><img src="../../images/m4/m4_equations/Eqn047.gif" width="206" height="148" /></div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final  volume of the dilute solution is 83 mL. Since the volume transferred from the  original solution was 50 mL, an additional 33 mL of water must be added to the  original solution.</p>

<p>In this  lesson you explored the following essential questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How can the concentration of solute in a solution be expressed?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How do you calculate amount concentration and determine the  concentrations of chemical species produced by dissociation?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How are solutions prepared in a lab? </li>
</ul>
<p>Your study in  this lesson has expanded your knowledge of solution chemistry and has enabled  you to prepare and dilute solutions of a desired concentration. In solution  chemistry, many questions must be solved mathematically; and you now have an  understanding of how formulas can be applied to predict the concentration of  dissociated ions in a solution.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>amount concentration: </strong>the proportion of solute (in moles) to volume of  solution</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>aqueous  phase:</strong> a phase denoting a  highly soluble substance that has been dissolved in water; denoted by (aq)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arrhenius acid: </strong>a substance that ionizes in water to produce hydrogen  ions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arrhenius base: </strong>an ionic compound that dissociates in water to produce  hydroxide ions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>concentration</strong>: a property  of solutions; the mass, volume, or  number of moles of solute present in proportion to the quantity of solvent or  total solution</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>conductivity:</strong> the ability of a  solution to transfer  an electric current</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dissociation: </strong>the separation of ions that occurs when an ionic  compound dissolves in water</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dynamic  equilibrium: </strong>the idea that  there is a balance between two opposing processes (forward and reverse)  occurring at the same rate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>electrolyte:</strong> a solution that conducts an electric current</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>endothermic: </strong>absorbing energy from the surroundings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>exothermic: </strong>releasing energy to the surroundings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>immiscible: </strong>a term used to describe liquids that do not dissolve  in each other</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ionization: </strong>a process by which a neutral atom or molecule is  converted to an ion; the reaction of substances in water to create ions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>nonelectrolyte:</strong> a solution that does not conduct an electric current</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>saturated  solution: </strong>a solution that contains the maximum quantity of solute for a specified temperature; in which no more  solute will dissolve at a specified temperature; at maximum solute concentration</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>solubility: </strong>the concentration of a saturated solution at a  specified temperature</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>solute:</strong> a component of a solution, the material that  dissolves in the solvent</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>solution: </strong>a homogeneous mixture  of at least one solute dissolved in a solvent</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>solvent: </strong>a component of a solution,  the material in which the solute dissolves</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>stock solution: </strong>a concentrated solution that is used in the  preparation of more dilute solutions of the same solute</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>turbidity:</strong> the measure of the clarity of a clear  liquid</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think  back to the questions you were asked at the beginning of the module.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are some of your preconceived notions about  solution chemistry?<br />
  </li>
  <li>Have you acquired new knowledge from this module that  contradicts prior beliefs?</li>
</ul>
<p>As you worked through these lessons, you likely came across a few  things that challenged your prior beliefs about solutions. Perhaps the following  thoughts came to mind: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Brass and air are solutions, even though  you likely never thought they were.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>While the dissolving process of sugar and  salt may appear to be visually identical, they dissolve in water for different  reasons.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Crystals of salt or  sugar at the bottom of a saturated solution are not static.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>The improper disposal of computers can  have an effect on people living as far north as the Arctic. </li>
</ul>
