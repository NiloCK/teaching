<h4>Lesson 2&mdash;<strong>Dissolving  Substances</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><a></a><strong>Water in the  Aquarium</strong></h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dissolved  substances play a tremendous role in aquarium water. Fish are living creatures  that are very sensitive to the concentrations of various chemicals. The following  is a list of chemicals that must be closely monitored for fish to survive in a  tank:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>chlorine:</strong> Even though the amount of chlorine in  tap water is very small, it can cause distress to fish. A chemical additive  called a dechlorinator must be added to tap water in order to remove the  chlorine.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>ammonia: </strong>Fish  are continuously producing ammonia in their waste. In a natural ecosystem, this  is not a problem because the fish are not confined. However, in an aquarium,  the buildup of ammonia is toxic to fish. Some of the symptoms fish exhibit upon  exposure to high levels of tank ammonia are<br />
    <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; loss of appetite<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; red streaking on fins or body<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; internal hemorrhaging and death<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Test kits can be purchased to test for excess amounts of ammonia. There are  also chemicals that can be added to the water to neutralize the ammonia.  However, the best way to solve this problem is with prevention, and an aquarium  can make use of natural organisms to help control excess ammonia dissolved in  the water. In general, ammonia poisoning in fish occurs most often in new  tanks, but it can happen in established tanks as well if too many fish are in  the tank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Converting Ammonia to Nitrate</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The nitrogen cycle in an aquarium is the biological/chemical process of  removing fish waste before it becomes toxic to the fish. When a new tank is  purchased, it should be &ldquo;cycled&rdquo; before adding fish. This process involves the  establishment of beneficial bacteria in the filter media that removes ammonia  by converting it into less harmful chemicals.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The three stages of the nitrogen cycle are as follows:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <div class="right3block"><img src="../../images/m4/016_fish_tank.jpg" alt="A diagrammatic representation of the nitrogen cycle. Four major features are shown in the diagram: a fish, an aquatic plant, the aquarium water, and the decomposing plant and animal matter at the bottom of the tank. A large arrow labelled food points toward the fish. A large arrow points from the fish toward the bottom of the tank and a label ammonium in the water. A large arrow points from the decomposing matter toward the ammonium label. Small white arrow extends within the aquarium water part of the diagram. A branched arrow extends from the ammonium label to a second label titled nitrites. The second branch of this arrow is toward the aquatic plant. An arrow extend form the nitrite label to a third label, titled nitrates. An arrow extends from nitrates to the aquatic plant." width="445" height="282" /></div>
<p><strong>Stage 1:</strong> The concentration of ammonia present in the fish tank increases due to  fish waste and the decomposition of uneaten food. If a new tank is being  cycled, ammonia drops can be added in the absence of fish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <strong>Stage 2:</strong> Bacteria, called nitrosomonas, in the tank take up the ammonia, which undergoes a chemical  reaction that yields nitrite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stage 3:</strong> A different type of bacteria, called nitrobacter, converts the nitrite  into nitrate, which is relatively safe compared to ammonia and nitrite.  However, nitrate can become toxic over time if allowed to build up. Therefore,  it is necessary to change the water regularly to keep the nitrate levels within  an acceptable margin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A failure to  understand the chemistry behind aquarium water is the main reason people get  frustrated with keeping fish.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>oxygen: </strong>Fish need oxygen to survive. Even though  oxygen levels are usually kept at sufficient levels by normal tank procedures,  conditions may arise that could indicate the oxygen levels in a tank are  dropping to low levels. Some of the things to watch out for are<br />
      <br />
    &ndash; plants in the tank not receiving sufficient lighting<br />
    &ndash; too many fish in the tank <br />
    &ndash; greenish water<br />
    &ndash; high water temperature</li>
</ul>
<p>It is fairly easy to introduce more oxygen to the tank. Simply mixing the water  with your hand will draw air into the water and increase the oxygen content.
</p>
<ul>
      <li>      <strong>phosphorus: </strong>Phosphorus is a substance that can be initially present in tap water or  may enter the fish tank from the incorrect use of detergents. Phosphorus is a  nutrient that promotes algae outbreaks. The growth of algae is dangerous to fish  because competition will take place for the limited resources in the tank. It  is important to test the aquarium for phosphates to prevent algae growth. In  larger bodies of water phosphorous can also promote increased algae growth,  with a potential to damage the aquatic habitat. To further study this effect  you may wish to use the search terms <em>eutrophication</em>, <em>phosphorous</em>, and <em>bodies of water</em>.</li>
  </ul>
