<h4>Module Glossary</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>amount concentration: </strong>the proportion of solute (in moles) to volume of  solution</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>aqueous  phase:</strong> a phase denoting a  highly soluble substance that has been dissolved in water; denoted by (aq)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arrhenius acid: </strong>a substance that ionizes in water to produce hydrogen  ions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arrhenius base: </strong>an ionic compound that dissociates in water to produce  hydroxide ions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>concentration</strong>: a property  of solutions; the mass, volume, or  number of moles of solute present in proportion to the quantity of solvent or  total solution</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>conductivity:</strong> the ability of a  solution to transfer  an electric current</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dissociation: </strong>the separation of ions that occurs when an ionic  compound dissolves in water</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>dynamic  equilibrium: </strong>the idea that  there is a balance between two opposing processes (forward and reverse)  occurring at the same rate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>electrolyte:</strong> a solution that conducts an electric current</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>endothermic: </strong>absorbing energy from the surroundings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>exothermic: </strong>releasing energy to the surroundings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>immiscible: </strong>a term used to describe liquids that do not dissolve  in each other</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ionization: </strong>a process by which a neutral atom or molecule is  converted to an ion; the reaction of substances in water to create ions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>nonelectrolyte:</strong> a solution that does not conduct an electric current</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>saturated  solution: </strong>a solution that contains the maximum quantity of solute for a specified temperature; in which no more  solute will dissolve at a specified temperature; at maximum solute concentration</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>solubility: </strong>the concentration of a saturated solution at a  specified temperature</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>solute:</strong> a component of a solution, the material that  dissolves in the solvent</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>solution: </strong>a homogeneous mixture  of at least one solute dissolved in a solvent</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>solvent: </strong>a component of a solution,  the material in which the solute dissolves</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>stock solution: </strong>a concentrated solution that is used in the  preparation of more dilute solutions of the same solute</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>turbidity:</strong> the measure of the clarity of a clear  liquid</p>
