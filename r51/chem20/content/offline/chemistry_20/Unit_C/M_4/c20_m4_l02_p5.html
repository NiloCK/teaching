<p>Dr. David  Schindler is an internationally renowned ecologist at the University of Alberta.  He has conducted extensive research on how human activities can damage  freshwater reserves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the environmental problems we face today, fresh water is  probably the most important. Our lakes and streams are Mother Nature&rsquo;s sewers,  and the water tends to reflect everything we do. There exists here a myth of  abundance with regard to fresh water. We are told that Canada has more  fresh water than any other country. In fact, there is a lack of fresh water  available to the most populated parts of Canada, and most fresh water is in  the north or flowing towards the north. Alberta,  in particular, has a water deficit: evaporation is greater than precipitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the late 1960s, Dr.  Schindler conducted research in the ELA (Experimental Lakes Area), a set of 58  lakes in the Precambrian Shield of northwestern Ontario. This set of lakes is reserved for  large-scale experiments of ecosystem stressors. One of Dr. Schindler&rsquo;s main  contributions to ecology was his research on the effect of phosphorus-based  fertilizers and detergents on lakes. Dr. Schindler helped show that not all  nutrients dissolved in water are necessarily beneficial&mdash;they can have  unforeseen consequences when imposed on delicate ecosystems.</p>

    <td width="40%"><strong>ELA Lake 226</strong> was the site of a visually spectacular experiment. The lake   was divided into two approximately equal portions using a plastic divider   curtain. Carbon and nitrogen were added to one half of the lake, while carbon,   nitrogen <strong>and phosphorus</strong> were added to the other half. For eight   consecutive years, the side receiving phosphorus developed eutrophic algal   blooms, while the side receiving only carbon and nitrogen did not (see photo,   below). However, after only two years, this experiment convinced even the   skeptics that <em><U>phosphorus</U> is the key nutrient</em>.</td>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SC 9.</strong> Dissolving occurs when  the molecules of a liquid surround the solute, resulting in dissociation,  ionization, or dispersion. Dissolving a substance is a physical change since no  new substances are produced.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SC 10.</strong> An endothermic process  draws energy from the surroundings. An observation of many endothermic changes  is a reduction in the temperature of the system or matter being investigated.  For example, water evaporation is endothermic. Your skin feels colder when  water evaporates because energy is drawn from your skin to fuel the  evaporation.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>An exothermic  process releases energy to the surroundings, increasing the temperature. For  example, the chemical reaction in a heat pack is exothermic. The surplus energy  warms up the solution and the heat pack feels hot.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SC 11.</strong> No. The act of  dissolving always requires energy to dissociate, ionize, or disperse a  substance.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <strong>SC 12. </strong>Water  molecules do not simply float around in isolation; they are closely packed with  other water molecules and experience intermolecular forces. Before a group of  water molecules can come together to surround and dissolve a solute, they must  first break free from the hydrogen bonds with adjacent water molecules.  Therefore hydrogen bonds between water molecules can be considered to have  attractive forces between them, some of which must be overcome in order for  associations to occur between water molecules and the solute particles. Given  the large number of water molecules involved in this process, the energy can be  significant even though it is typically far less than the energy required to  break the ionic bond.
