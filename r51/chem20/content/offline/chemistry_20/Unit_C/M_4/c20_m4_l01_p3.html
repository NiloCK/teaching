<h6>Classification of Solutions</h6>

<p>Metals such as  gold are called &ldquo;precious metals&rdquo; because they are rare in nature and have a  high economic value. Since ancient times, gold jewellery has been produced as a  means of displaying wealth and status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One problem with the use of gold for jewellery is the softness of the  metal. You may have seen a gold ring that has been worn so long that it is no  longer round because it has shaped itself to the finger of the person wearing  it. Gold in its pure form is actually too soft to use in jewellery&mdash;it can bend  out of shape very easily. Fortunately, the strength of most jewellery is  improved significantly by mixing the gold with other metals to form a solution  called an alloy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you wearing  a gold ring? Can you read the stamp on the inside of the band? You may have  noticed that the stamp indicated that the gold is 10 k or 14 k. When gold is  labelled as being 24 karat, it means 24 parts are pure gold and no other metal  is present. If gold is 18 karat, 18 parts of the 24 total possible parts are  gold and the 6 remaining parts are some other metal, which together forms the  alloy. A ring that is 24-karat gold will more easily bend out of shape than a  ring that is 18-, 14-, or 10-karat gold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only does  an alloy solution improve the strength of the jewellery, it can dramatically  change the appearance of the jewellery too! The only difference between yellow  gold and white gold is the type of metal being mixed with the gold. You will  soon understand how solution chemistry plays an important role in the production  of yellow gold and white gold rings.</p>

<h6>Definition  and Types of Solutions</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <strong>solution</strong> is composed of a <strong>solute</strong> dissolved in a <strong>solvent</strong>. Solutes and solvents may be  solids, liquids, or gases. The following table shows how various combinations  lead to different types of solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="left4blockC">
  <p><strong>solution: </strong>a homogeneous mixture  of at least one solute dissolved in a solvent</p>
  <p><br />
      <strong>solute:</strong> a component of a solution, the material that  dissolves in the solvent</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>solvent: </strong>a component of a solution,  the material in which the solute dissolves</p>

<p>The most  important property of a solution is homogeneity. This means that the solution  will have an identical composition throughout. If you use a micropipette to  analyze an extremely small sample of a solution, it will have exactly the same  composition as the larger mixture. Substances like milk and fog are not  considered to be solutions because they are heterogeneous mixtures. In a true  solution, the solute particles will not separate from the solvent on standing,  nor can they be filtered out.</p>
