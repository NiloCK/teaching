<h6><strong><img src="../icons/read.gif" width="35" height="31" /> Read</strong></h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read the section &ldquo;Properties of  Aqueous Solutions&rdquo; on pages 193 and 194 in your textbook to learn more about  the test for conductivity and the properties of acidic, basic, and neutral  solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>The  Aqueous Phase</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you read in the previous  section, drinking water can contain many dissolved substances. Not only can  dissolved substances provide colour or taste, but they can make a solution have  other unique properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right1blockC">
  <p><strong>aqueous  phase: </strong>a phase denoting a  highly soluble substance that has been dissolved in water; denoted by (aq)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>conductivity: </strong>the ability of a  solution to transfer  an electric current</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>electrolyte:</strong> a solution that conducts an electric current</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>nonelectrolyte:</strong> a solution that does not conduct an  electric current</p>

<p>If sugar is  dissolved in water, can it still it be written as C<span class="subscript">12</span>H<span class="subscript">22</span>O<span class="subscript">11</span>(s)?  The answer to this question is no, since the sugar molecules are no longer  behaving as a crystalline solid&mdash;they are dispersed throughout the solution. The <strong>aqueous phase</strong> (aq) is used to  indicate that a substance is dissolved in water. Note that a solute is said to  be aqueous only if it is dissolved in water. If it is dissolved in a different  solvent, such as alcohol, the phase would be written (alc).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two other  properties often considered when investigating solutions are conductivity and  acidity. (Solubility is another property, which will be addressed in a later  lesson.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some  solutions demonstrate<strong> conductivity.</strong> A solution that conducts  electricity contains <strong>electrolytes</strong>.  Electrolytes are charged ions present within a solution. Their ability to move  allows a current to be established within a solution. Tap water conducts  electricity because the ions of dissolved solutes are present, while pure  distilled water would not conduct electricity since no ions are present. Many  molecular compounds form solutions that are <strong>nonelectrolytes </strong>because the solute does not form ions  when it dissolves. Therefore, solutions containing dissolved molecular  compounds do not conduct electricity.</p>
