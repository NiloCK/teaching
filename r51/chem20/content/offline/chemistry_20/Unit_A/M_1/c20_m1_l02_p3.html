        <p>Current theories about the atom&rsquo;s structure  suggest that atoms have higher stability when their energy levels are filled to  capacity with electrons.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Consider the <strong>noble gases</strong>.  These elements are found in Group 18 on the periodic table and are known for  their tendencies to be unreactive. As the theories you have studied to this  point suggest, all noble gases have completely filled energy levels. For  example, neon&mdash;which has 10 electrons surrounding the nucleus&mdash;has 2 electrons in  the first energy level  and 8 electrons in the second energy level. Both energy levels  are  completely filled. Because they are filled, neon is a stable gas and is very  unreactive.<br />

        <p>Read &ldquo;Formation  of Monatomic Ions&rdquo; on pages 23 and 24 of the textbook. After you have completed  your reading, comment on the validity of the following statement:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Atoms will  gain or lose electrons to have an electron configuration like that of the  nearest noble gas. When atoms gain or lose electrons, they become charged  particles called <em>ions</em>. Energy level diagrams for ions can be drawn in a similar  way as energy level diagrams for atoms. The difference is in showing a positive  or negative charge on the ion.&rdquo;</p>

        <p><strong>SC 5. </strong>Draw the phosphide ion.  The phosphorus atom has 15 protons and 16 neutrons. In a phosphorus atom, the  electrons are placed into three energy levels with 2, 8, and 8 electrons,  respectively, from the innermost energy level to the outermost energy level. The  phosphorus atom will gain 3 electrons to fill its valence energy level and become  the phosphide ion. With this gain of electrons, the atom is no longer neutral;  it now has 3 extra negative charges. This charge is included with the symbol as  shown.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><img src="../../images/m1/010_chart.jpg" alt="A drawing contains one rectangle. The rectangle is positioned so that its longer side runs vertically. In the lower third of the rectangle is a circle. Inside the circle is the text 15 lower case p superscript plus sign, and 16 lower case n. Below the circle is the text upper case P superscript 3 minus. Just above the circle is a horizontal line with the label 2 lower case e superscript minus. Above this line is a second and a third horizontal line labeled 8 lower case e superscript minus. " width="49" height="107" /></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>SC 6.</strong> The beryllium atom has 4 protons and 5 neutrons. It has 4 electrons  placed in a 2-2 configuration. The beryllium atom will lose 2 valence electrons  to become a beryllium ion. With this loss of electrons, the beryllium atom now  has 2 extra protons compared to electrons. This shows up as a 2+ charge on the  ion. Its electron configuration is now like helium, the nearest noble gas.</p>
