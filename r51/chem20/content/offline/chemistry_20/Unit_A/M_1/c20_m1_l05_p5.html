<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Lesson Summary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reflect on the  critical questions asked at the beginning of this lesson:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What is the particle model of       matter?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>What is the kinetic molecular       theory?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>What are the types of changes       in matter, and what evidence is there that a chemical change has occurred? </li>
</ul>
<p>In this lesson  you compared and contrasted physical changes, chemical changes, and nuclear  changes.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Phase changes involve the       rearrangement of particles that affect the bonds between particles       (intermolecular bonds). These changes are characterized by having       relatively small energy changes and no new substances formed.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Chemical changes involve the       rearrangement of particles that affect the bonds within a particle       (intramolecular bonds). Chemical changes are characterized by having       larger energy changes and the formation of new substances with new       properties.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Nuclear changes involve the       rearrangement of sub-atomic particles within an atom (nuclear bonds).       These changes are characterized by having massive energy changes, the       formation of new elements, and the release of radiation.</li>
</ul>
<p>You took a  brief look at the kinetic molecular theory, which states that the tiny entities  within any substance are constantly in random motion. This led you to the study  of the collision-reaction theory in which the motion of entities results in  collisions and the possibility of new substances forming in a chemical  reaction. You reviewed the law of conservation of mass, which states that the  total mass present before a chemical change is equal to the total mass present  after a chemical change.</p>

<h5>Lesson Glossary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>endothermic process:</strong> a change in matter that  requires an input of energy to occur</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>exothermic  process:</strong> a change in matter that releases energy when it  occurs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>intermolecular:</strong> existing or acting between  molecules</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>nuclear change:</strong> a  process that causes an alteration to the  composition of an atom&rsquo;s nucleus</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>physical change:</strong> a change in the form of a substance in which its chemical composition is unchanged</p>
