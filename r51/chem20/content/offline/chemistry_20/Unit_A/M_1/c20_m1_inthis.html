        <h4>In This Module</h4>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h5>Lesson 1 &mdash;Elements and Ions</h5>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This lesson  will review the structure and function of the periodic table. You'll study  atomic structure and the relationship among protons, neutrons, and electrons.  You will then learn how atoms become ions and study how they form charged  particles due to an imbalance of protons and electrons.</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p> From Science 10, can you identify elements and       ions?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p> How does scientific knowledge       develop through hypothesizing, investigating, and collecting evidence?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p> How do the observations and       experimental work of many individuals lead to modern understandings of       matter?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p> Do theories develop as a result       of the sharing of ideas by many scientists?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p> What is the role of evidence in       the development of the atomic model?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p> Why is it important to have a       questioning attitude and a desire to understand more about matter?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>How have Canadians contributed       to the research?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Lesson 2 &mdash;Ionic Compounds</h5>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This lesson  will focus on ionic compounds, such as table salt (sodium chloride). Naming and  writing formulas for ionic compounds is of critical importance in this lesson.  You will examine the process of forming ionic compounds involving binary  compounds, multi-valent metals, polyatomic ions, and hydrates. You will learn  that ionic compounds are solids at room temperature and, if they are soluble in  water, form conducting solutions. You will also study electronegativity and how  it affects the formation of a chemical bond through the competition for bonding  electrons.</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p> Can you recall the principles       for assigning names to ionic compounds from Science 10?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p> How does an ionic bond form?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p> Why do formulas for ionic       compounds refer to the simplest whole-number ratio of ions?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>What are valence electrons?       What is electronegativity? What is an intramolecular force?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Lesson 3 &mdash;Molecular Elements and Compounds</h5>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The focus in  this lesson is on molecular elements and compounds, like sugar. They can be  found in any state at standard conditions and, unlike ionic compounds, if they are soluble in  water, they do <strong>not</strong> form conducting solutions. You will learn how to name  formulas for molecular elements and compounds using the prefix system. You will  study how they form as a result of two or more atoms sharing electrons. You  will explore how the difference in electronegativity between two atoms helps  identify the bond between the atoms.</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p> From Science 10, can you recall the principles       for assigning names to molecular substances?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>How does the difference in       electronegativity within a compound affect bonding?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Lesson 4 &mdash;The Particle Model</h5>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This lesson  compares and contrasts physical changes, chemical changes, and nuclear changes by  examining the changes that occur to the particles involved.</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>What is the particle model of       matter?<br />
              <br />
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>What is the kinetic molecular       theory?<br />
              <br />
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>What are the types of changes in matter, and what evidence is there that  a chemical change has occurred?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
