<div class="right1blockA"><strong>nuclear change: </strong>a process that causes an<strong> </strong>alteration to the composition of an atom&rsquo;s nucleus</div>
<p>Harnessing nuclear energy  involves many changes for matter. As you have already learned in this module,  chemical change must occur to process uranium from its ore into the nuclear  fuel used in a reactor. Certain isotopes of uranium undergo <strong>nuclear change</strong> as  they become converted into other types of atoms and release radiation. The  radiation released is used to heat water to produce steam, an example of a  third type of matter change&mdash;a physical change.&nbsp;  What is common to all of these kinds of change? How are each of these kinds of changes unique? Scientists often use models and theories to explain events that are not  observable. In this lesson you will not only learn about the particle model for  matter and the kinetic molecular theory, but you will discover how they can be  used to explain matter changes described in this module.</p>
