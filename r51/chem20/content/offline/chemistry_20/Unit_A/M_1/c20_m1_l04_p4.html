      <p>You may wish to research the following questions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What kind of  radiation is classified as ionizing radiation?</li>
        <li>What effect  does ionizing radiation have on water?</li>
        <li>Why is there  concern about changes to matter as a result of exposure to ionizing radiation?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Reflect on the  critical questions asked at the beginning of this lesson:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>          From Science 10, can you recall       the principles for assigning names to molecular substances?</li>
      </ul>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>
          <p>How does the difference in       electronegativity within a compound affect bonding?</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Molecular  elements and molecular compounds can be found in any state at SATP and, if they  are soluble in water, they do not form conducting solutions. You reviewed the  principles for naming molecular compounds using the prefix system and  recognized that the names of some common molecular compounds have to be  memorized. You also reviewed how to write formulas for molecular elements and  compounds. You learned that molecular compounds result from two or more atoms  sharing electrons. You also discussed electronegativity and how the difference  in electronegativity between two atoms influences the characteristics of the  bond between the atoms (e.g., ionic, polar covalent, or non-polar covalent).</p>

      <h5>Lesson  Glossary</h5>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>molecule:</strong> an entity consisting of a  group of non-metal atoms held together by covalent bonds</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>radiation:</strong> energy released or  transmitted in the form of rays, waves, or particles</p>
