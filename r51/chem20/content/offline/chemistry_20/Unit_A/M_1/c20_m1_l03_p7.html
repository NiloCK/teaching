        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>Do you recall the principles from Science 10 for assigning names to ionic compounds?</p>

            <p>How does an ionic bond form from the simultaneous attraction of oppositely charged ions? </p>

        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>Why do formulas for ionic compounds refer to the simplest whole-number ratio of ions?</p>

        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>What are valence electrons? What is electronegativity? What is an ionic bond? What is an intramolecular force?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use  what you have learned during this lesson to answer these questions. If you  record your answers, place a copy of them into your chemistry folder along with  your other completed lesson work.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ionic compounds surround  you. They are formed when a metal transfers one or more electrons to a  non-metal. Ionic compounds may involve multi-valent metals, polyatomic ions,  and hydrates. These compounds are solid at room temperature and, if soluble in  water, form conducting solutions. In this lesson you reviewed the rules for  naming and identifying four different types of ionic compounds. You learned the  importance of maintaining electrical neutrality in an ionic compound and  determined the ratio of ions that yields a net charge of zero. Finally, you  studied electronegativity and how it affects the formation of a chemical bond  through competition for bonding electrons.</p>

        <h5>Lesson  Glossary</h5>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>binary ionic compound:</strong> a compound that contains  only two kinds of monatomic ions</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>chemical formula:</strong> a series of symbols  representing the atoms/ions, and their proportions, present in a pure substance</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>coefficient:</strong> a number used to represent  the quantity of molecules or the formula unit of a substance; a number that  precedes a chemical formula</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>compound:</strong> a pure substance that can  be separated into its elements by heat or electricity; a substance containing  atoms/ions of more than one element in a definite fixed proportion</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>electronegativity:</strong> a value that describes the relative  ability of an atom to attract a pair of electrons</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>hydrate:</strong> a substance containing  loosely bonded water molecules</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>intramolecular force:</strong> the relatively strong bonds  or forces of attraction and repulsion within a molecule; typically covalent  bonds</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>ionic bond:</strong> the simultaneous attraction  among positive and negative ions</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>monatomic ion:</strong> a positively or negatively  charged particle formed from a single atom by the loss or gain of electrons;  also known as a simple ion</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>multi-valent:</strong> the ability of an atom to exist  as ions with different charges</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>polyatomic ion:</strong> a combination of two or  more non-metal atoms that have a net charge not equal to zero</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>solubility:</strong> the concentration of a  saturated solution at a specified temperature</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>water of crystallization:</strong> water within a crystal,  which is necessary for the maintenance of crystalline properties but capable of  being removed by sufficient heat</p>
