<p>What do you know about  nuclear technology? Is there more to nuclear technology than bombs? Have you or  someone you know ever had an X-ray, ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI? Have you ever  heard of &ldquo;The Manhattan Project,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Trinity Test,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Cuban Missile  Crisis&rdquo;? What about the use of nuclear weapons during World War II or the incidents at Three Mile Island and  Chernobyl? Do you, your family, or your community have an opinion about nuclear  technology? Do you know anyone who has been directly affected by nuclear  technology? If so, was the experience positive or negative?</p>

<p>The history of nuclear  power in Canada  begins in the 1940s with the development of the ZEEP (Zero Energy Experimental  Pile) reactor. On September 5, 1945, ZEEP became the first active nuclear reactor  outside of the United States.  Its purpose was to allow scientists to carry out nuclear experiments and to  test the viability of nuclear power. Canada&rsquo;s experimentation with the  ZEEP reactor led to the development of the CANDU (CANada Deuterium Uranium)  reactor in the 1960s. In 2006, there were approximately 37 active CANDU  reactors in countries around the world, including Canada,  South Korea, China, India,  Argentina, Romania, and Pakistan.</p>
