        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Reflect on the  critical questions from the beginning of this lesson:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Do you remember how to identify elements and ions?<br />
              <br />
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>How does scientific knowledge develop through hypothesizing, investigating, and collecting evidence?<br />
              <br />
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>How do the observations and experimental work of many individuals lead to modern understandings of matter?<br />
              <br />
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Do theories develop as a result of many scientists sharing ideas?<br />
              <br />
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>What role does evidence have in the development of the atomic model?<br />
              <br />
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Why is it important to have a questioning attitude and a desire to understand more about matter?<br />
              <br />
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>How have Canadians contributed to nuclear research?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this lesson you  reviewed the structure and function of the periodic table. You also reviewed  basic atomic structure and the importance of protons, neutrons, and electrons  in that structure. You extended your atomic knowledge and applied it to ions as  well, understanding that they are charged particles due to an imbalance of  protons and electrons. This lesson also illustrated how the observations and experimental  work of many individuals led to the current understanding of the atom. This  work has also allowed for the development of a process to use the energy from a  nuclear change.</p>

        <h5>Lesson Glossary</h5>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>electron:</strong> a small, negatively charged  subatomic particle; has a specific energy within an atom</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>energy level:</strong> a specific energy an  electron can have in an atom or ion</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>family:</strong> see <em>group</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>group:</strong> a set of elements with  similar chemical properties; the elements in a vertical column in the main part  of the periodic table; also called a family</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>neutral:</strong> having neither acidic nor basic properties; having a net charge of zero (electrically neutral)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>neutron:</strong> an uncharged subatomic particle present in the nuclei of most atoms</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>noble gas:</strong> elements listed in column 18 of the periodic table that demonstrate limited chemical reactivity</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>period:</strong> a horizontal row of elements in the periodic table whose properties gradually change from metallic to non-metallic from left to right along the row</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>proton:</strong> a positively charged subatomic particle found in the nucleus.</p>
