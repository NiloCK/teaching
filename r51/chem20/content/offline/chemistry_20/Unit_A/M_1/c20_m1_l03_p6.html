        <p>Recall from  Science 10 that all ionic compounds are solids at room temperature. These  compounds have high boiling points due to the strong attractions within their  crystal lattice. You also know that ionic compounds produce conducting  solutions if they are soluble in water.</p>

        <p>The multimedia segment &ldquo;<a href="javascript:full('../../mm/m1/c20_u1_m1_l03_Mystery_Lab/mystery_final_v2.html');">Chemistry Mystery Lab</a>&rdquo; has you solving a puzzling problem in a chemistry lab. This problem  can be solved by using knowledge about ionic compounds and <strong>solubility</strong>. To  review solubility, including how to use the solubility table, read page 61 in  your textbook. In the applet, you will be presented with four beakers. Each  beaker contains an unknown solid. You&rsquo;ll see four identifying labels that have  fallen off the beakers. In this activity you will use your knowledge of ionic  compounds and information about the melting points of these substances to match the  label with the correct beaker. You will need to search the Internet to gather  this data.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Take a look  through your home or school to see if you can identify some ionic compounds  found within common items. Try looking at food and beverage ingredients or on the  labels of cleaning supplies.&nbsp; Discuss, with your classmates or some other people, the name of the compound, the  chemical formula of the compound, and the substance you found it in.</p>
