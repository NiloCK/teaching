<h6>Changes in Matter and  Energy </h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout your  study of chemistry, you have used the particle theory, which is an explanation  of the properties of matter being composed of tiny particles. In this lesson  you will explore physical, chemical, and nuclear changes and use your knowledge  of the particle theory to discuss their similarities and differences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Physical  Changes</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the Internet to locate information about  the particle theory. How does this theory explain the different states in which  matter can exist? In terms of the particles involved, how are the molecules of  H<span class="subscript">2</span>O in ice, water, and steam different? How are  these particles the same? Summarize your answers in a chart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right1blockA">
  <p><strong>phase change: </strong>a change of a substance  from one physical state to another</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A change from a solid to a liquid, a liquid to a gas, or a solid to a gas  is a phase change.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>endothermic process:</strong> a change in matter that  requires an input of energy to occur</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>exothermic  process:</strong> a change in matter that releases energy when it  occurs</p>
</div>
<p>As you learned from your  comparison of the arrangement of particles in the different states of matter,  the change from one state to another (<strong>phase change)</strong> does not involve the  breaking of chemical bonds. During a phase change, no new substances are formed.  There is just a rearrangement of the particles involved. In order to cause such  a rearrangement, energy is used. Energy is required to change the level of  motion of the particles to such an extent that they can overcome forces between  other particles. In Module 2 you will learn more about intermolecular bonds  within a substance and their effects on physical properties of matter. These  effects may include melting and boiling temperatures. Compared with other  changes in matter, phase changes involve relatively small amounts of energy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The table lists the  equations involved in the phase changes of one mole of water and the energy  associated with those changes. When energy is absorbed (<strong>endothermic process</strong>), it is written on the left-hand side of the  equation (the reactant side). When energy is released (<strong>exothermic process</strong>), it is written on the right-hand side of the  equation (the product side).</p>

<p>How do these  reactions demonstrate that a change in matter does not affect the covalent  bonds in the water molecule?</p>

<h6>Observing Evidence of a  Chemical Change&mdash;Volcano!</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Volcano Dough</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a large  mixing bowl, combine 1.5 L <span class="nowrap">(6 cups)</span> of flour, 500 mL <span class="nowrap">(2 cups)</span> of salt, 60 mL <span class="nowrap">(4  tablespoons)</span> of cooking oil, and 500 mL <span class="nowrap">(2 cups)</span> of warm water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Creating the Volcano</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Place a small soft-drink bottle in the middle of a cookie sheet and use  the volcano dough to build a volcano around the bottle. Be careful not to drop  dough inside the bottle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Eruption</h6>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Fill a 600-mL soft-drink bottle       about three-quarters full with warm water.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Add some red food colouring to       make the lava look real.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Add about 6 drops of dish soap       to the soft-drink bottle to help the lava bubble.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Add 30 mL (2 tablespoons) of       baking soda (not baking powder) to the solution in the soft-drink bottle.</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Once you&rsquo;re ready, add enough       vinegar&mdash;approximately 100 mL&mdash;to start a vigorous reaction. Watch the       eruption that follows!</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>When the reaction slows, you can add more vinegar to make the volcano  erupt again. The volcano can be made to erupt several more times by adding more  vinegar over the course of 15 to 20 minutes. The reaction taking place is  between the baking soda and the vinegar, which produces carbon dioxide gas and  increases the pressure in the bottle to cause the eruption. Have fun!</p>
