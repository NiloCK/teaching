<P>Richard Taylor was born in Medicine Hat, Alberta, in 1929. He attended the University of Alberta. Taylor was involved in the production of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in California. While working with two other scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Taylor used the accelerator to dispel the belief that protons and neutrons were indivisible. His experiments in the late 1960s and early 1970s showed extremely small particles moving within protons and neutrons. These new particles were called <EM>quarks</EM>. In 1990, Richard Taylor was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his findings.<BR></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>More information about Dr. Taylor’s work is located in “Did You Know?” on page 23 of the textbook and in the “Weblinks” for <SPAN class=nowrap>Section 1.4</SPAN> on the textbook website.</P>
