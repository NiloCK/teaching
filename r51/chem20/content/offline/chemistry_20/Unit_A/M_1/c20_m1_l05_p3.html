<p>Chemical reactions involve  the breaking of bonds<strong> </strong>within<strong> </strong>reactant molecules, a complete  rearrangement of the atoms, and the forming of product molecules that consist  of bonds with atoms different than those in the reactant molecules. Therefore,  a chemical change involves a change in intramolecular bonds in matter.  Intramolecular bonds, like the ionic and covalent bonds you have studied in  this module, are much stronger than <strong>intermolecular</strong> bonds. Therefore, in  most cases, a chemical change involves a larger energy change than a physical  change. In many cases, chemical changes are difficult or impossible to reverse.  In a chemical change, new substances are formed with different properties than  those of the starting materials. Most of your study in Chemistry 20 will focus  on chemical changes.</p>

<p>How do you know  if a chemical change has occurred? The key to identifying a chemical change is  being able to detect the formation of a new substance. All chemical reactions  involve the production of new substances. Several clues indicate a chemical  change has occurred:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>colour change </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>odour (smell) change </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>state change&mdash;usually bubbles       indicating a gas is formed or a solid precipitate is forming </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>energy change&mdash;most commonly       detected by a change in temperature </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>It is important  to understand that these clues are a general guide and that identifying one of  these changes doesn&rsquo;t necessarily indicate a chemical change. For example, if  you heat water above 100&deg;C, it will boil and produce bubbles. However, these  bubbles are due to the state of water being changed. It is not a chemical  change, since no new substance is formed. In cases where the evidence is  unclear, you can often use simple diagnostic tests to determine whether a new  product has been formed.</p>

<p><strong>Nuclear  Change</strong></p>

<div class="right2block">

<p>The particle theory of matter applies to the subatomic particles that  make up atoms. Subatomic particles are influenced by the nuclear force&mdash;the  force of attraction between protons, between neutrons, and between protons and  neutrons. Nuclear forces are much stronger than the forces between electrons  and protons that result in chemical bonds. In fact, the nuclear force is the  strongest force known. Since extremely large forces are needed to hold nuclear  particles together, extremely large quantities of energy are required to break  these intranuclear bonds and extremely large quantities of energy are released  when subatomic particles reassemble. In a nuclear reaction, the rearrangement  of protons and neutrons causes new products to be formed. In the case of a  nuclear power plant, energy in the form of radiation<strong> </strong>is  emitted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Example</h6>
<br />
Uranium is a common nuclear fuel. The nuclear reaction involving uranium-235 is  illustrated below.
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><img src="../../images/m1/m1_equations/Eqn002.gif" alt="" width="322" height="28" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this  equation you will notice that <em>n</em> represents a neutron and that the process yields different kinds of atoms due  to the rearrangement of protons and neutrons that occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice that the  energy involved in the nuclear change is incredibly large (1.85 x 10<span class="superscript">10</span> kJ) compared to that of a  chemical change (2220 kJ) or phase change (6.01 kJ and 40.65 kJ).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following  is a summary:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Phase changes involve the       rearrangement of particles that affect the bonds between particles (intermolecular       bonds). These changes are characterized by having relatively small energy       changes and no new substances formed.<br />
      <br />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chemical changes involve the       rearrangement of particles that affect the bonds within a particle (intramolecular       bonds). Chemical changes are characterized by having larger energy changes       and the formation of new substances with new properties.<br />
      <br />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nuclear changes involve the rearrangement of sub-atomic particles within  an atom (nuclear bonds). These changes are characterized by having massive  energy changes, the formation of new elements, and the release of radiation.</p>
