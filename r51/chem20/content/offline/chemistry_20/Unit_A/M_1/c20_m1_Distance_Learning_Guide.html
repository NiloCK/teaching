Concepts, models, and theories are often used to interpret and explain observations and to predict future observations. This unit relates theories about bonding to the properties of matter and develops explanations and descriptions of structure and bonding through scientific models. You will learn about the diversity of matter by investigating ionic and molecular substances.</p>

<p>The history of nuclear  power in Canada  begins in the 1940s with the development of the ZEEP (Zero Energy Experimental  Pile) reactor. On September 5, 1945, ZEEP became the first active nuclear reactor  outside of the United States.  Its purpose was to allow scientists to carry out nuclear experiments and to  test the viability of nuclear power. Canada&rsquo;s experimentation with the  ZEEP reactor led to the development of the CANDU (CANada Deuterium Uranium)  reactor in the 1960s. In 2006, there were approximately 37 active CANDU  reactors in countries around the world, including Canada,  South Korea, China, India,  Argentina, Romania, and Pakistan.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h5>Lesson 1 &mdash;Elements and Ions</h5>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This lesson  will review the structure and function of the periodic table. You'll study  atomic structure and the relationship among protons, neutrons, and electrons.  You will then learn how atoms become ions and study how they form charged  particles due to an imbalance of protons and electrons.</p>
        <ul type="disc">

        <h5>Lesson 2 &mdash;Ionic Compounds</h5>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This lesson  will focus on ionic compounds, such as table salt (sodium chloride). Naming and  writing formulas for ionic compounds is of critical importance in this lesson.  You will examine the process of forming ionic compounds involving binary  compounds, multi-valent metals, polyatomic ions, and hydrates. You will learn  that ionic compounds are solids at room temperature and, if they are soluble in  water, form conducting solutions. You will also study electronegativity and how  it affects the formation of a chemical bond through the competition for bonding  electrons.</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p> Can you recall the principles       for assigning names to ionic compounds from Science 10?</p>

        </ul>
        <h5>Lesson 3 &mdash;Molecular Elements and Compounds</h5>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The focus in  this lesson is on molecular elements and compounds, like sugar. They can be  found in any state at standard conditions and, unlike ionic compounds, if they are soluble in  water, they do <strong>not</strong> form conducting solutions. You will learn how to name  formulas for molecular elements and compounds using the prefix system. You will  study how they form as a result of two or more atoms sharing electrons. You  will explore how the difference in electronegativity between two atoms helps  identify the bond between the atoms.</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p> From Science 10, can you recall the principles       for assigning names to molecular substances?</p>

        </ul>
        <h5>Lesson 4 &mdash;The Particle Model</h5>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This lesson  compares and contrasts physical changes, chemical changes, and nuclear changes by  examining the changes that occur to the particles involved.</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>What is the particle model of       matter?<br />

<p>
Earth&rsquo;s crust is composed mainly of oxygen. The oxygen found in the crust is not in gaseous form as it is in the atmosphere. Instead, oxygen is a component found in solid compounds, such as rocks and minerals. Oxygen, like many elements, can exist in different forms. How does the structure of atoms differ when atoms of the same element have different forms? In this lesson you will review and extend your understanding of models of the atom and look at how these models are used to explain the different forms in which matter can exist. You will also see how these models relate to the availability of uranium, which is the energy source for nuclear reactors.

        <p>The organization of data  into patterns or common characteristics helps scientists understand the  material they are studying. In dealing with matter, elements are classified  according to their <strong>atomic numbers</strong>. The atomic number indicates the  number of protons (positively charged particles) found within the atom. Along  with the atomic number, the elements are also categorized according to how they  react. The result of this classification is the Periodic Table of the Elements.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The first periodic table  was published in 1869 by Russian scientist Dmitri Mendeleev. He listed the data  for the known elements&mdash;there were approximately 60 elements at that time&mdash;on  file cards and set about arranging them in patterns. He left spaces in his  arrangement for elements he believed were yet to be discovered. Because of the  patterns within the periodic table, he was even able to predict the properties  of these undiscovered elements. This held true as new elements were discovered  and placed in the table.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <div class="right1blockA">
          <p><strong>group: </strong>a set of elements with  similar chemical properties; the elements in a vertical column in the main part  of the periodic table; also called a family </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>family: </strong>see <em>group</em></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>period: </strong>a  horizontal row of elements in the periodic table whose properties gradually  change from metallic to non-metallic from left to right along the row</p>
        </div>
        <p>The elements within the  table are positioned according to <strong>group</strong> (or <strong>family</strong>) and <strong>period</strong>. Groups correspond to the  vertical columns on the periodic table and are labelled from 1 to 18 across the  top of the table. Periods denote the horizontal rows on the periodic table.  There are seven periods on the table.</p>

        <h6><img src="../icons/read.gif" alt="" width="36" height="32" align="bottom" /> Read</h6>

        <p>Read pages 14  to 16 in the textbook to review the organization of the periodic table.
          A version of the  periodic table is also available in the Chemistry Databook. You will often use  this version of the table as you work through this course and Chemistry 30.</p>

        <p>Many versions of the  periodic table are available on the Internet. Use the search terms &ldquo;periodic  table&rdquo; and &ldquo;interactive&rdquo; to find versions that may even allow you to hear the pronounciation  of element names. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As you work through this  course you will use many values shown  in the cells within  the periodic table. In many cases, the values listed identify properties of  each element and were used by Mendeleev and other scientists to construct and  refine the position of elements on the periodic table.</p>

        <p><strong>SC 2.</strong> Calcium has an atomic  number of 20. This means there are 20 protons in the nucleus and 20 electrons  orbiting around the nucleus. The atomic mass is 40.08. To determine the number  of neutrons in the nucleus, simply subtract the atomic number from the atomic  mass to get a value of 20 neutrons.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>SC 3.</strong> With an atomic number  of 12, there will be 12 protons in the nucleus and 12 electrons orbiting the  nucleus. The atomic mass is 24.31, so there are 12 neutrons in the nucleus.  Because magnesium has 12 electrons, 2 electrons appear in the first orbital, 8  electrons appear in the second orbital, and the remaining 2 electrons appear in  the third orbital.</p>

        <p>Current theories about the atom&rsquo;s structure  suggest that atoms have higher stability when their energy levels are filled to  capacity with electrons.</p>

        <p>Consider the <strong>noble gases</strong>.  These elements are found in Group 18 on the periodic table and are known for  their tendencies to be unreactive. As the theories you have studied to this  point suggest, all noble gases have completely filled energy levels. For  example, neon&mdash;which has 10 electrons surrounding the nucleus&mdash;has 2 electrons in  the first orbital and 8 electrons in the second orbital. Both orbitals are  completely filled. Because they are filled, neon is a stable gas and is very  unreactive.<br />

<P>Richard Taylor was born in Medicine Hat, Alberta, in 1929. He attended the University of Alberta. Taylor was involved in the production of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in California. While working with two other scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Taylor used the accelerator to dispel the belief that protons and neutrons were indivisible. His experiments in the late 1960s and early 1970s showed extremely small particles moving within protons and neutrons. These new particles were called <EM>quarks</EM>. In 1990, Richard Taylor was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his findings.<BR></P>

You also reviewed  basic atomic structure and the importance of protons, neutrons, and electrons  in that structure. You extended your atomic knowledge and applied it to ions as  well, understanding that they are charged particles due to an imbalance of  protons and electrons. This lesson also illustrated how the observations and experimental  work of many individuals led to the current understanding of the atom. This  work has also allowed for the development of a process to use the energy from a  nuclear change.</p>

<p>
Canada is one of the world&rsquo;s largest producers of uranium. Unfortunately, uranium does not naturally occur in a form usable in CANDU nuclear reactors, so it must be processed. In Lesson 1 you learned that many metals exist naturally in their ionic form and are often combined with non-metallic elements like oxygen. The mining and processing of uranium is a complex industry occurring in Canada and other locations in the world. Processing involves the conversion of uranium into other compounds that allows uranium to perform as a nuclear fuel. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>
In this lesson you will investigate questions about the structure and properties of ionic compounds, and you will relate these properties to considerations about uranium and the effect that processing uranium could have on the environment.

          Ionic compounds are formed when a metallic element combines with a non-metallic element (e.g.,  NaCl).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>View this video about the formation of  NaCl. You may wish to &ldquo;pause&rdquo; the video and draw the representations of the  sodium and chlorine atoms before they react and after they react. What happens,  with respect to the arrangement of electrons around these two atoms, when the  compound sodium chloride is made? Is this change consistent with what you  learned in the previous lesson?</p>

        <p>Ionic compounds  are formed when electrons are transferred from a metal to a non-metal. As you  saw in the most recent video, an ionic compound forms when the metal will lose  electrons to have filled energy levels. Also, the non-metal will gain electrons  to have filled energy levels. The transfer of electrons between metals and non-metals  produces positively and negatively charged particles (ions) that attract each  other to form an ionic bond.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>An ionic bond is  the result of an intramolecular force caused by the attraction of oppositely  charged particles. You will examine four different types of ionic compounds:</p>
        <ul type="disc">

      <p>The formula of  an ionic compound must have a net charge of zero. The positive charge of a  lithium ion combined with the equal and opposite charge of a fluorine atom  results in an electrically neutral compound.</p>

<h5>Multi-Valent Metals</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The refining of uranium involves a variety of uranium compounds including  U<span class="subscript">3</span>O<span class="subscript">8</span>, UO<span class="subscript">3</span>, and UO<span class="subscript">2</span>. How are these  different oxides of uranium identified using names? Read &ldquo;Multi-Valent Metals&rdquo;  on pages 29 and 30 of your textbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Multi-valent  metals have more than one charge due to different electron configurations. When  naming a compound containing one of these metals, you must indicate which charge  (or form) is involved. The charge of the metallic ion is denoted using Roman  numerals. The Roman numerals for numbers 1 to 7 are shown.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>1 &ndash; I<br />
        2 &ndash; II<br />
        3 &ndash; III<br />
        4 &ndash; IV<br />
        5 &ndash; V<br />
        6 &ndash; VI<br />
        7 &ndash; VII</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Ionic compounds  containing multi-valent metals are named in the same way as binary ionic  compounds, with the addition of a Roman numeral. After you write the name of  the metal, you must indicate its charge using the appropriate Roman numeral in  brackets. The name of the non-metal ion follows, and the ion still uses the ending  -<em>ide</em>.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h6>Example</h6>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Determine the  name of MnO<span class="subscript">2</span>.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>First, you need  to determine the charge of the Mn ion (either 2+ or 4+). To figure out the  charge on the multi-valent metal ion, use the charge and subscript of the  non-metal ion. Recall that all ionic compounds have a net charge of zero.</p>

      <p>The charge on  the Mn ion in MnO is +2, and the name for the compound is manganese(II) oxide.</p>

      <p>Is the name of  the other oxide of manganese, MnO<span class="subscript">2</span>, manganese(IV) oxide?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>You can determine the formula of an ionic compound containing a  multi-valent metal in the same way you determined the formula for a binary  ionic compound. Just remember that the Roman numeral indicates the charge on  the multi-valent metal.</p>

      <p>Note that the more common  form of a multi-valent metal is listed first on the periodic table (either the  higher or the farthest left of the two charges given in the box on the periodic  table). For example, Fe<span class="superscript">3+</span> is more common than Fe<span class="superscript">2+</span>. If  the ion of a multi-valent metal is not specified in the description or in a  question, you can assume Fe<span class="superscript">3+</span> is the most common ion.</p>

		 <h5>Polyatomic Ions</h5>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Read &ldquo;Compounds with Polyatomic Ions&rdquo; on page 30 of your textbook. Ionic compounds  may contain polyatomic ions (also called complex ions). A polyatomic ion  consists of a group of elements that have an overall charge. Almost all  polyatomic ions are negatively charged and act as non-metals in the way they  bond with metals. The only positively charged polyatomic ion you need to be  concerned with is ammonium (NH<span class="subscript">4</span><span class="superscript">+</span>), which acts as a metal  to bond with a non-metal or a negatively charged polyatomic ion.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In order to  name an ionic compound containing a polyatomic ion, name the metal followed by  the polyatomic ion as it is written in the table of polyatomic ions.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h6>Example</h6>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>NaOH</p>
        <p>Metal ion = sodium</p>
        <p>Polyatomic ion  (OH<span class="superscript">&minus;</span>) = hydroxide</p>
        <p>Name = sodium  hydroxide</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The chemical  formula can be determined from the name. Recall that the net charge of an ionic  compound must be zero.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>An ionic hydrate is formed when an ionic compound combines with water.  The water is found within the ionic crystal, but it is not directly bonded to  the compound itself. Ionic hydrates can be broken down into two parts. The  first part is the portion containing the ionic compound and is written  according to the rules you&rsquo;ve learned in this lesson. The second part is often  referred to as the <strong>water of crystallization</strong> and is named by writing  &ldquo;&mdash;water (X:Y)&rdquo;, where X is the <strong>coefficient </strong>in front of the  ionic compound and Y is the coefficient in front of the water portion.</p>

To  review solubility, including how to use the solubility table, read page 61 in  your textbook. In the applet, you will be presented with four beakers. Each  beaker contains an unknown solid. You&rsquo;ll see four identifying labels that have  fallen off the beakers. In this activity you will use your knowledge of ionic  compounds and information about the melting points of these substances to match the  label with the correct beaker. You will need to search the Internet to gather  this data.</p>

        <p>Ionic compounds surround  you. They are formed when a metal transfers one or more electrons to a  non-metal. Ionic compounds may involve multi-valent metals, polyatomic ions,  and hydrates. These compounds are solid at room temperature and, if soluble in  water, form conducting solutions. In this lesson you reviewed the rules for  naming and identifying four different types of ionic compounds. You learned the  importance of maintaining electrical neutrality in an ionic compound and  determined the ratio of ions that yields a net charge of zero. Finally, you  studied electronegativity and how it affects the formation of a chemical bond  through competition for bonding electrons.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

Picture yourself sitting on a quiet beach in July. It's hot, and the sky above you is a crystalline blue. On the horizon you can see clouds building up, maybe hinting of a thunderstorm later in the evening. A light breeze blows and cools your skin. And then it's still and hot again. You grab your glass of cold water that still contains a few remaining ice cubes. The glass has condensation droplets all over it; so you rub the glass on your forehead to try to cool off. You realize that this drink isn't going to cool you off for very long, so maybe it&rsquo;s time to go into the water.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>
Water is perhaps the most important <strong>molecule</strong>. Without water, there would be no life on Earth. Your body is made up of between 60% and 70% water. Water is a molecule produced by the chemical joining of two hydrogen atoms to a single oxygen atom. Scientists have explained this kind of bond as a sharing of electrons between atoms.
</p>

<p>
<strong>molecule: </strong>an entity consisting of a group of <span class="nowrap">non-metal</span> atoms held together by covalent bonds
</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;

</p>
<br />
Sharing electrons may occur between the same (molecular elements, including elements that exist in a pure form in diatomic and polyatomic groups) or different non-metal atoms (molecular compounds). You may recall from your study in Science 10 that many molecular compounds are named using a <span class="nowrap">prefix-naming</span> system, whereas the names of other molecular compounds must be memorized. Molecular elements and compounds can be found in solid, liquid, and gaseous form at standard ambient temperature and pressure (SATP) and do not form conducting solutions. Is there a relationship between the properties of water, and other molecular compounds, and this type of bonding?

      <p>The prefix naming system  is only used for a limited number of molecular compounds. There are millions of  molecular compounds that cannot be named using this system, for example, those  composed of more than two elements. Other naming systems or memorized common  names are used to name these other molecular compounds.</p>

      <p>Molecular  elements and molecular compounds can be found in any state at SATP and, if they  are soluble in water, they do not form conducting solutions. You reviewed the  principles for naming molecular compounds using the prefix system and  recognized that the names of some common molecular compounds have to be  memorized. You also reviewed how to write formulas for molecular elements and  compounds. You learned that molecular compounds result from two or more atoms  sharing electrons. You also discussed electronegativity and how the difference  in electronegativity between two atoms influences the characteristics of the  bond between the atoms (e.g., ionic, polar covalent, or non-polar covalent).</p>

<div class="right1blockA"><strong>nuclear change: </strong>a process that causes an<strong> </strong>alteration to the composition of an atom&rsquo;s nucleus</div>
<p>Harnessing nuclear energy  involves many changes for matter. As you have already learned in this module,  chemical change must occur to process uranium from its ore into the nuclear  fuel used in a reactor. Certain isotopes of uranium undergo <strong>nuclear change</strong> as  they become converted into other types of atoms and release radiation. The  radiation released is used to heat water to produce steam, an example of a  third type of matter change&mdash;a physical change.&nbsp;  What is common to all of these kinds of change? How are each of these kinds of changes unique? Scientists often use models and theories to explain events that are not  observable. In this lesson you will not only learn about the particle model for  matter and the kinetic molecular theory, but you will discover how they can be  used to explain matter changes described in this module.</p>

<h6>Changes in Matter and  Energy </h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout your  study of chemistry, you have used the particle theory, which is an explanation  of the properties of matter being composed of tiny particles. In this lesson  you will explore physical, chemical, and nuclear changes and use your knowledge  of the particle theory to discuss their similarities and differences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Physical  Changes</h6>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the Internet to locate information about  the particle theory. How does this theory explain the different states in which  matter can exist? In terms of the particles involved, how are the molecules of  H<span class="subscript">2</span>O in ice, water, and steam different? How are  these particles the same? Summarize your answers in a chart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right1blockA">
  <p><strong>phase change: </strong>a change of a substance  from one physical state to another</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A change from a solid to a liquid, a liquid to a gas, or a solid to a gas  is a phase change.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>endothermic process:</strong> a change in matter that  requires an input of energy to occur</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>exothermic  process:</strong> a change in matter that releases energy when it  occurs</p>
</div>
<p>As you learned from your  comparison of the arrangement of particles in the different states of matter,  the change from one state to another (<strong>phase change)</strong> does not involve the  breaking of chemical bonds. During a phase change, no new substances are formed.  There is just a rearrangement of the particles involved. In order to cause such  a rearrangement, energy is used. Energy is required to change the level of  motion of the particles to such an extent that they can overcome forces between  other particles. In Module 2 you will learn more about intermolecular bonds  within a substance and their effects on physical properties of matter. These  effects may include melting and boiling temperatures. Compared with other  changes in matter, phase changes involve relatively small amounts of energy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The table lists the  equations involved in the phase changes of one mole of water and the energy  associated with those changes. When energy is absorbed (<strong>endothermic process</strong>), it is written on the left-hand side of the  equation (the reactant side). When energy is released (<strong>exothermic process</strong>), it is written on the right-hand side of the  equation (the product side).</p>

  <li>
    <p>Add some red food colouring to       make the lava look real.</p>
  </li>

    <p>Add 30 mL (2 tablespoons) of       baking soda (not baking powder) to the solution in the soft-drink bottle.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>Once you&rsquo;re ready, add enough       vinegar&mdash;approximately 100 mL&mdash;to start a vigorous reaction. Watch the       eruption that follows!</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>When the reaction slows, you can add more vinegar to make the volcano  erupt again. The volcano can be made to erupt several more times by adding more  vinegar over the course of 15 to 20 minutes. The reaction taking place is  between the baking soda and the vinegar, which produces carbon dioxide gas and  increases the pressure in the bottle to cause the eruption. Have fun!</p>

  <p><strong>intermolecular: </strong>existing or acting between molecules</p>
</div>
<p>Chemical reactions involve  the breaking of bonds<strong> </strong>within<strong> </strong>reactant molecules, a complete  rearrangement of the atoms, and the forming of product molecules that consist  of bonds with atoms different than those in the reactant molecules. Therefore,  a chemical change involves a change in intramolecular bonds in matter.  Intramolecular bonds, like the ionic and covalent bonds you have studied in  this module, are much stronger than <strong>intermolecular</strong> bonds. Therefore, in  most cases, a chemical change involves a larger energy change than a physical  change. In many cases, chemical changes are difficult or impossible to reverse.  In a chemical change, new substances are formed with different properties than  those of the starting materials. Most of your study in Chemistry 20 will focus  on chemical changes.</p>

<p>How do you know  if a chemical change has occurred? The key to identifying a chemical change is  being able to detect the formation of a new substance. All chemical reactions  involve the production of new substances. Several clues indicate a chemical  change has occurred:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <p>colour change </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>odour (smell) change </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>state change&mdash;usually bubbles       indicating a gas is formed or a solid precipitate is forming </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>energy change&mdash;most commonly       detected by a change in temperature </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>It is important  to understand that these clues are a general guide and that identifying one of  these changes doesn&rsquo;t necessarily indicate a chemical change. For example, if  you heat water above 100&deg;C, it will boil and produce bubbles. However, these  bubbles are due to the state of water being changed. It is not a chemical  change, since no new substance is formed. In cases where the evidence is  unclear, you can often use simple diagnostic tests to determine whether a new  product has been formed.</p>

</div>
<p>The particle theory of matter applies to the subatomic particles that  make up atoms. Subatomic particles are influenced by the nuclear force&mdash;the  force of attraction between protons, between neutrons, and between protons and  neutrons. Nuclear forces are much stronger than the forces between electrons  and protons that result in chemical bonds. In fact, the nuclear force is the  strongest force known. Since extremely large forces are needed to hold nuclear  particles together, extremely large quantities of energy are required to break  these intranuclear bonds and extremely large quantities of energy are released  when subatomic particles reassemble. In a nuclear reaction, the rearrangement  of protons and neutrons causes new products to be formed. In the case of a  nuclear power plant, energy in the form of radiation<strong> </strong>is  emitted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Example</h6>
<br />
Uranium is a common nuclear fuel. The nuclear reaction involving uranium-235 is  illustrated below.
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><img src="../../images/m1/m1_equations/Eqn002.gif" alt="" width="322" height="28" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this  equation you will notice that <em>n</em> represents a neutron and that the process yields different kinds of atoms due  to the rearrangement of protons and neutrons that occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice that the  energy involved in the nuclear change is incredibly large (1.85 x 10<span class="superscript">10</span> kJ) compared to that of a  chemical change (2220 kJ) or phase change (6.01 kJ and 40.65 kJ).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following  is a summary:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Phase changes involve the       rearrangement of particles that affect the bonds between particles (intermolecular       bonds). These changes are characterized by having relatively small energy       changes and no new substances formed.<br />
      <br />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chemical changes involve the       rearrangement of particles that affect the bonds within a particle (intramolecular       bonds). Chemical changes are characterized by having larger energy changes       and the formation of new substances with new properties.<br />

<p>In Module 1 you learned  about the role of science and technology in society, elements and ions, ionic  compounds, molecular compounds, chemical change, and the kinetic molecular  theory. You explored the roles of modelling, evidence, and theories when  explaining and understanding the structure, bonding, and properties of ionic  and molecular compounds. Throughout the module you studied these concepts in  the context of nuclear energy, shaping your perspectives and understandings of  nuclear technology.</p>

<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Lesson Summary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reflect on the  critical questions asked at the beginning of this lesson:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>What is the particle model of       matter?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>What is the kinetic molecular       theory?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>What are the types of changes       in matter, and what evidence is there that a chemical change has occurred? </li>
</ul>
<p>In this lesson  you compared and contrasted physical changes, chemical changes, and nuclear  changes.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Phase changes involve the       rearrangement of particles that affect the bonds between particles       (intermolecular bonds). These changes are characterized by having       relatively small energy changes and no new substances formed.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Chemical changes involve the       rearrangement of particles that affect the bonds within a particle       (intramolecular bonds). Chemical changes are characterized by having       larger energy changes and the formation of new substances with new       properties.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Nuclear changes involve the       rearrangement of sub-atomic particles within an atom (nuclear bonds).       These changes are characterized by having massive energy changes, the       formation of new elements, and the release of radiation.</li>
</ul>
<p>You took a  brief look at the kinetic molecular theory, which states that the tiny entities  within any substance are constantly in random motion. This led you to the study  of the collision-reaction theory in which the motion of entities results in  collisions and the possibility of new substances forming in a chemical  reaction. You reviewed the law of conservation of mass, which states that the  total mass present before a chemical change is equal to the total mass present  after a chemical change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson Glossary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>endothermic process:</strong> a change in matter that  requires an input of energy to occur</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>exothermic  process:</strong> a change in matter that releases energy when it  occurs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>intermolecular:</strong> existing or acting between  molecules</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>nuclear change:</strong> a  process that causes an alteration to the  composition of an atom&rsquo;s nucleus</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>physical change:</strong> a change in the form of a substance in which its chemical composition is unchanged</p>

<h4><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Module Summary</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this module  you discovered that science is a complex mix of observation and theory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A salt crystal  can be easily observed: it is a hard, white, crystalline solid. However, if you  want to know which elements make up that salt crystal or why it has the  properties it does, an understanding of theoretical concepts is required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A theoretical  entity you studied extensively in this module is the electron. Electrons play a  vital role in chemistry since all chemical bonding is the result of electron  behaviour. A salt crystal is a hard, ionic solid because an electron is  transferred from a sodium atom to a chlorine atom that results in a strong,  ionic bond. Other compounds, however, do not form an ionic bond; they form a  covalent bond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A molecule of  methane contains carbon and hydrogen atoms that share an electron. The nature  of a chemical bond can be determined by looking at the electronegativity  differences between atoms making up the compound. Depending on how large this  difference is, a compound may be nonpolar covalent, covalent, or ionic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, you studied the kinetic molecular theory, which states that the  tiny entities within any substance are continuously in random motion. This  theory helps answer many questions, such as why chemical reactions occur, why  ink spreads more slowly in cold water than in hot water, and why a balloon  shrinks when put in a freezer. You will learn the answers to these questions as  you proceed through this course.</p>
