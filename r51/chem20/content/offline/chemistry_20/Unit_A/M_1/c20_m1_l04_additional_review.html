      <h6>Additional Review of Molecular Compounds</h6>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The molecular  elements are bonded  together as pairs (diatomic elements) or in groups of three, four, or eight  (polyatomic elements). There are ten molecular elements that you need to  memorize. Seven are diatomic molecular elements. This means they are found as  pairs of atoms when in their natural state. These elements include</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>
          <p>nitrogen N<span class="subscript">2</span>(g)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>oxygen O<span class="subscript">2</span>(g)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>fluorine F<span class="subscript">2</span>(g)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>chlorine Cl<span class="subscript">2</span>(g)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>bromine Br<span class="subscript">2</span>(l)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>iodine I<span class="subscript">2</span>(s)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>hydrogen H<span class="subscript">2</span>(g)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Polyatomic  elements include the following:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>
          <p>phosphorus, found in nature as       P<span class="subscript">4</span>(s)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>sulfur, found in nature as S<span class="subscript">8</span>(s)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>oxygen, in the form of ozone, O<span class="subscript">3</span>(g)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>One way to  remember the seven diatomic elements is to start at element 7 (nitrogen) on the  periodic table, and trace a &quot;7&quot; (move right to fluorine and then down  to iodine). Counting the elements in the &ldquo;7&rdquo; shape, you will find six elements.  The seventh is hydrogen&mdash;it is way up in the top left-hand corner of the  periodic table.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Another way to  remember the diatomic elements is that they all end in either <em>-ine</em> (fluorine, chlorine, bromine,  iodine) or <em>-gen</em> (hydrogen, nitrogen,  oxygen). For the polyatomic elements, you may find it helpful to remember that  phosphorus and sulfur are found beneath the top part of the &ldquo;7&rdquo; shape.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h6>Describing and Naming  Molecular Compounds</h6>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Molecular  compounds are composed of at least two different non-metals. Examples of  molecular compounds are water (H<span class="subscript">2</span>O), glucose (C<span class="subscript">6</span>H<span class="subscript">12</span>O<span class="subscript">6</span>),  carbon dioxide (CO<span class="subscript">2</span>), and propane (C<span class="subscript">3</span>H<span class="subscript">8</span>).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Naming binary  molecular compounds requires the use of prefixes to indicate the quantity of  particular atoms within the compound. Molecular compounds involving nitrogen  and oxygen provide excellent examples of how the naming system is applied.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>N<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">5</span> =    dinitrogen pentaoxide<br />
N<span class="subscript">2</span>O<span class="subscript">4</span> = dinitrogen    tetraoxide</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In these two  examples, prefixes must be used for both nitrogen and oxygen since they both  have subscripts. The ending for a molecular compound is -<em>ide</em>; so, the second atom name must change  to accommodate this.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>NO<span class="subscript">2</span> = nitrogen dioxide<br />
Nitrogen does  not have a subscript, so no prefix is required. Oxygen does have a subscript  and, therefore, requires a prefix.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>NO = nitrogen  monoxide</p>
      <p>Nitrogen does not have a subscript, so no prefix is required. Oxygen  does not have a subscript either; but since it comes second, it must be written  with the prefix <em>mono</em>-.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In this course  you must memorize the listed prefixes.</p>

      </table>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>These guided  examples will give you further insight into naming molecular compounds.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h6><strong>Example</strong></h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>What is the  name for CCl<span class="subscript">4</span>?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Notice that  there is one carbon atom and four chlorine atoms. Since there is only one  carbon atom and it is the first atom in the formula, the first part of the name  is simply carbon (no <em>mono</em>-  prefix). Four chlorine atoms are represented by tetrachloride. Therefore, CCl<span class="subscript">4</span> is carbon tetrachloride.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>To write the  formula from the compound name, reverse the process.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h6>Example</h6>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>What is the  chemical formula for trisulfur hexaiodide?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The prefix <em>tri</em>- indicates that there are three atoms  of sulfur. The prefix <em>hexa</em>-  indicates there are six atoms of iodine. Therefore, the chemical formula is S<span class="subscript">3</span>I<span class="subscript">6</span>.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Unlike ionic  compounds, molecular compounds are not written with the lowest possible ratio.  The following example illustrates why:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>
          <p>C<span class="subscript">2</span>H<span class="subscript">2</span> is       commonly called acetylene and is used in welding. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>C<span class="subscript">6</span>H<span class="subscript">6</span> is commonly called benzene       and is used as an industrial solvent. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These are two  very different molecular compounds that would both reduce to CH in the simplest  ratio. If you found a container labelled CH, how would you know what it is?  Remember that ionic compounds reduce to the simplest ratio but molecular  compounds do not.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>You may have  noticed that states have not been discussed when dealing with molecular  compounds. States of molecular compounds do not follow simple rules and may be  found in solid, liquid, and gaseous states at SATP. Other than memorizing the  states of common molecular compounds, there is no easy way to determine their states.</p>
