      <div class="right1blockA"><strong>monatomic ion:</strong> a positively or negatively  charged particle formed from a single atom by the loss or gain of electrons;  also known as a simple ion</div>
      <p>Binary ionic  compounds are composed of two kinds of <strong>monatomic ions</strong>. They are the  simplest type of ionic compounds. The compounds are named by writing the name  of the metal as it appears on the periodic table, followed by the name of the  non-metal with the ending -<em>ide</em>.</p>

      <p>Take a look at  lithium fluoride by using a simplified diagram showing only electrons in the  outermost energy level of each atom involved.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <table width="90%" border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="5">
        <tr>

        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><p>Lithium will give away  the valence electron to the fluorine atom.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The formula of  an ionic compound must have a net charge of zero. The positive charge of a  lithium ion combined with the equal and opposite charge of a fluorine atom  results in an electrically neutral compound.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Now take a look  at beryllium fluoride.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>You can see from the periodic table that the beryllium ion has a charge  of 2+.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <table width="90%" border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="5">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><p>Beryllium has two  valence electrons to  give away.</p>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>A fluoride ion  has a charge of 1<span class="superscript">&minus;</span>. With a 1:1 ratio, you have Be<span class="superscript">2+</span> and F<span class="superscript">&minus;</span>.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (2+) + (1&minus;) = 1+</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>This is no good. This compound is not stable because it doesn't have a  net electrical charge of zero. How do you fix this? You need to have two  fluoride ions to obtain an overall charge of zero.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <table width="90%" border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="5">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><p>Since beryllium has <strong>two</strong> electrons to give away, two fluorine atoms are required to accept each  electron.</p>

          <td valign="top"><p>There are now two  fluoride ions held to the beryllium ion through ionic bonds.</p>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>BeF<span class="subscript">2</span> has a net charge of  zero. The beryllium ion has a charge of 2+, and the two fluoride ions each have  a charge of 1&minus;. The end result is that the entire compound is electrically  neutral.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <div class="right1blockA">
        <p><strong>chemical formula: </strong>a series of symbols representing the atoms/ions, and their proportions,  present in a pure substance</p>
      </div>
      <p>There is a quicker way to  write <strong>chemical formulas</strong> from the name. This involves writing the symbols  of the ions first, and then simply swapping their superscripts and writing them as  subscripts.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h6><strong>Example</strong></h6>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Using the example of barium phosphide, write the two ions and include their charges.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Write the two  ions and include their charges.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ba<span class="superscript">2+</span>  P<span class="superscript">3&minus;</span> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Now, simply swap the superscripts and write them as subscripts. The  formula now becomes Ba<span class="subscript">3</span>P<span class="subscript">2</span>.</p>
