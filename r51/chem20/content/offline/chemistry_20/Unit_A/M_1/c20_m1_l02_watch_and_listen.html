        <p>Look at the chlorine atom,  and see how it becomes an ion.</p>

          <p>In this  animation you can watch the electron moving into the outer energy level of the  chlorine atom. Once it gains the electron, there are 18 electrons and 17  protons. This excess of negative charges relative to positive charges results  in a net charge of 1&minus;, and the chlorine atom has now become a chloride ion.  Notice that when non-metals become ions, the ending of their names is changed  to -<em>ide</em>. Once the electron is  added, this net charge is shown as Cl<span class="superscript">&minus;</span>.</p>

        <p>An energy-level  diagram of the chloride ion can also be drawn.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Notice that the electron  configuration (the way the electrons are distributed in the energy levels) is  now like argon&mdash;a noble gas. One final terminology note is that negatively  charged ions are called <strong>anions</strong>.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>But what  happens if the atom is a metal? How does it turn into an ion?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>All metals will  lose electrons in their outer energy levels to be like the nearest noble gas.  Look at aluminium, and see what happens to its electrons.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <div class="flash640x400">
          <script type="text/javascript">
		/*<![CDATA[*/

        <p><br />
        </p>
        <p>In this  animation you can see the 3 electrons in the outer energy level of the  aluminium atom. Because these 3 electrons are not bonded as strongly as the  other 10 electrons, aluminium will lose these electrons to other atoms that  have a strong attraction for them. As a result, the outer three electrons will  be pulled off the atom to cause a charge imbalance. There are now 13 protons in  the nucleus and only 10 electrons surrounding the nucleus, resulting in a net  charge of 3+ for aluminium. When the 3 electrons leave the atom, aluminium  becomes the aluminium ion and is written as Al<sup>3+</sup>.</p>

        <div class="right1block"><img src="../../images/m1/019_chart.jpg" alt="A drawing contains one rectangle. The rectangle is positioned so that its longer side runs vertically. In the lower third of the rectangle is a circle. Inside the circle is the text 13 lower case p superscript plus, and 14 n. Below the circle is a text upper case A lower case l superscript 3 plus. Just above the circle is a horizontal line with the label 2 lower case e superscript minus. Above this line is a second horizontal line labelled 8 lower case e superscript minus.

        <p>A condensed  version of the aluminium ion can also be drawn.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Notice that the aluminium  ion has an energy level diagram similar to the noble gas neon. Positively  charged ions are called <strong>cations.</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <div class="left2blockA"><strong>cation: </strong>a positively charged ion</div>
