        <div class="right1blockA"><strong>atomic number: </strong>the characteristic number of protons in the nucleus of an atom of a  particular element</div>
        <p>The organization of data  into patterns or common characteristics helps scientists understand the  material they are studying. In dealing with matter, elements are classified  according to their <strong>atomic numbers</strong>. The atomic number indicates the  number of protons (positively charged particles) found within the atom. Along  with the atomic number, the elements are also categorized according to how they  react. The result of this classification is the Periodic Table of the Elements.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The first periodic table  was published in 1869 by Russian scientist Dmitri Mendeleev. He listed the data  for the known elements&mdash;there were approximately 60 elements at that time&mdash;on  file cards and set about arranging them in patterns. He left spaces in his  arrangement for elements he believed were yet to be discovered. Because of the  patterns within the periodic table, he was even able to predict the properties  of these undiscovered elements. This held true as new elements were discovered  and placed in the table.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <div class="right1blockA">
          <p><strong>group: </strong>a set of elements with  similar chemical properties; the elements in a vertical column in the main part  of the periodic table; also called a family </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>family: </strong>see <em>group</em></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>period: </strong>a  horizontal row of elements in the periodic table whose properties gradually  change from metallic to non-metallic from left to right along the row</p>
        </div>
        <p>The elements within the  table are positioned according to <strong>group</strong> (or <strong>family</strong>) and <strong>period</strong>. Groups correspond to the  vertical columns on the periodic table and are labelled from 1 to 18 across the  top of the table. Periods denote the horizontal rows on the periodic table.  There are seven periods on the table.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Read pages 14  to 16 in the textbook to review the organization of the periodic table.
          A version of the  periodic table is also available in the Chemistry Databook. You will often use  this version of the table as you work through this course and Chemistry 30.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Many versions of the  periodic table are available on the Internet. Use the search terms &ldquo;periodic  table&rdquo; and &ldquo;interactive&rdquo; to find versions that may even allow you to hear the pronounciation  of element names. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As you work through this  course you will use many values shown  in the cells within  the periodic table. In many cases, the values listed identify properties of  each element and were used by Mendeleev and other scientists to construct and  refine the position of elements on the periodic table.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>SC 2.</strong> Calcium has an atomic  number of 20. This means there are 20 protons in the nucleus and 20 electrons  orbiting around the nucleus. The atomic mass is 40.08. To determine the number  of neutrons in the nucleus, simply subtract the atomic number from the atomic  mass to get a value of 20 neutrons.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>SC 3.</strong> With an atomic number  of 12, there will be 12 protons in the nucleus and 12 electrons orbiting the  nucleus. The atomic mass is 24.31, so there are 12 neutrons in the nucleus.  Because magnesium has 12 electrons, 2 electrons appear in the first energy level, 8  electrons appear in the second energy level, and the remaining 2 electrons appear in  the third energy level.</p>

The second circle is larger than the first one and has 8 small red spheres equally spaced around the circle. The third circle is larger than the second circle and has 2 small red spheres located at opposite sides of the circle.
