<p>Draw cartoons representing  physical, chemical, and nuclear changes. Ensure your artwork illustrates the  similarities and differences between the three types of change. Incorporate an  understanding of the particle model of matter and the kinetic molecular theory.  Share your cartoons with your classmates or some other people. Place copies of your cartoons into your  chemistry folder, along with any comments and revisions you make based on the  feedback from your classmates or  other people.</p>

<p>In Module 1 you learned  about the role of science and technology in society, elements and ions, ionic  compounds, molecular compounds, chemical change, and the kinetic molecular  theory. You explored the roles of modelling, evidence, and theories when  explaining and understanding the structure, bonding, and properties of ionic  and molecular compounds. Throughout the module you studied these concepts in  the context of nuclear energy, shaping your perspectives and understandings of  nuclear technology.</p>
