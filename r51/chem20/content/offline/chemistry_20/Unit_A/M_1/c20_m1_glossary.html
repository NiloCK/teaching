<p><strong>electron: </strong>a small, negatively    charged subatomic particle; has a specific energy within an atom</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>electronegativity: </strong>a value that describes    the relative ability of an atom to attract a pair of electrons</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>element:</strong><strong> </strong>a pure substance that    cannot be broken down into simpler chemical substances by any physical or    chemical means; consists of only one kind of atom </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>empirical knowledge: </strong>knowledge gained    through observation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>endothermic process:</strong> a change in matter    that requires an input of energy to occur</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>energy level:</strong> a specific energy an    electron can have in an atom or ion</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ethical perspective: </strong>a perspective that    bases decisions around accepted beliefs of a group</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>exothermic process: </strong>a change in matter    that releases energy when it occurs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>family:</strong> see <em>group</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>group:</strong> a set of elements with    similar chemical properties; the elements in a vertical column in the main    part of the periodic table; also called a family</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>hydrate: </strong>a substance containing    loosely bonded water molecules</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>intermolecular:</strong> existing or acting    between molecules</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>intramolecular force:</strong> the relatively strong    bonds or forces of attraction and repulsion within a molecule; typically    covalent bonds</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ion:</strong> an entity with a net    positive or net negative electrical charge due to the loss or gain of one or    more electrons </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ionic bond: </strong>the simultaneous    attraction among positive and negative ions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ionic compound:</strong> a pure substance    formed from the bond between a metal and a non-metal </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>kinetic molecular    theory: </strong>the idea that the    smallest entities of a substance&mdash;atoms, ions, or molecules&mdash;are in continuous    motion, colliding with each other and objects in their path</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>molecular compound: </strong>a pure substance    formed by covalently bonded non-metal atoms</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>molecule: </strong>an entity consisting    of a group of non-metal atoms held together by covalent bonds</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>monatomic ion:</strong> a positively or    negatively charged particle formed from a single atom by the loss or gain of    electrons; also known as a simple ion</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>multi-valent: </strong>the ability of an atom    to exist as ions with different charges</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>neutral:</strong> having neither acidic    nor basic properties; having a net charge of zero (electrically neutral)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>neutron:</strong> an uncharged subatomic    particle present in the nuclei of most atoms</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>noble gas:</strong> elements listed in    column 18 of the periodic table that demonstrate limited chemical reactivity</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>nuclear change: </strong>a process that causes    an alteration to the composition of an atom&rsquo;s nucleus</p>
