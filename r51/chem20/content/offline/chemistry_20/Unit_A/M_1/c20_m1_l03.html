Canada is one of the world&rsquo;s largest producers of uranium. Unfortunately, uranium does not naturally occur in a form usable in CANDU nuclear reactors, so it must be processed. In Lesson 1 you learned that many metals exist naturally in their ionic form and are often combined with non-metallic elements like oxygen. The mining and processing of uranium is a complex industry occurring in Canada and other locations in the world. Processing involves the conversion of uranium into other compounds that allows uranium to perform as a nuclear fuel. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
In this lesson you will investigate questions about the structure and properties of ionic compounds, and you will relate these properties to considerations about uranium and the effect that processing uranium could have on the environment.

<h6>Essential Questions</h6>
<div class="right2blockA">
<p>
<strong>ionic bond: </strong>the simultaneous attraction among positive and negative ions
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>intramolecular force: </strong>the relatively strong bonds or forces of attraction and repulsion within a molecule; typically covalent bonds
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>electronegativity:</strong> a value that describes the relative ability of an atom to attract a pair of electrons
