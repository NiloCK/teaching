<h4><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Module Summary</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this module  you discovered that science is a complex mix of observation and theory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A salt crystal  can be easily observed: it is a hard, white, crystalline solid. However, if you  want to know which elements make up that salt crystal or why it has the  properties it does, an understanding of theoretical concepts is required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A theoretical  entity you studied extensively in this module is the electron. Electrons play a  vital role in chemistry since all chemical bonding is the result of electron  behaviour. A salt crystal is a hard, ionic solid because an electron is  transferred from a sodium atom to a chlorine atom that results in a strong,  ionic bond. Other compounds, however, do not form an ionic bond; they form a  covalent bond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A molecule of  methane contains carbon and hydrogen atoms that share an electron. The nature  of a chemical bond can be determined by looking at the electronegativity  differences between atoms making up the compound. Depending on how large this  difference is, a compound may be nonpolar covalent, covalent, or ionic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, you studied the kinetic molecular theory, which states that the  tiny entities within any substance are continuously in random motion. This  theory helps answer many questions, such as why chemical reactions occur, why  ink spreads more slowly in cold water than in hot water, and why a balloon  shrinks when put in a freezer. You will learn the answers to these questions as  you proceed through this course.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The assessment  in this module consisted of four (4) assignments.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Module 1 Lesson 1 Assignment&nbsp; <strong>24 marks</strong></li>
  <li>
    <p>Module 1  Lesson 2 Assignment&nbsp; <strong>20 marks</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>Module 1  Lesson 3 Assignment&nbsp; <strong>22 marks</strong></li>
  <li>Module 1  Lesson 4 Assignment &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>8 marks</strong></li>
</ul>
