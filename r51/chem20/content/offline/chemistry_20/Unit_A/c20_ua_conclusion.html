<p>In this unit you have  studied many theories relating to the structure and organization of  matter. You have learned that electrostatic  attraction between oppositely charges particles is an important force used in  the organization of subatomic particles that make up atoms. Electrostatics is also involved when atoms  are together in a system.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>You also studied chemical technologies and how the principles of atomic structure and bonding apply to their performance  and development.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Throughout your study in  this unit, you have seen how these theories have been used to explain observable  properties of matter. You have  considered the differences in boiling points, as one property, as well as  others.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>You have learned that the study of chemical bonding is not complete, and  that new areas, including nanotechnology, require constant collection and  interpretation of data to understand how matter will behave at the atomic  level and in larger samples.</p>
