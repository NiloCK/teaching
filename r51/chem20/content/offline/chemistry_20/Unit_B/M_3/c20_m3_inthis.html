<h4>In This Module</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson 1&mdash;Properties of Gases and Boyle&rsquo;s  Law</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will begin  your study of gases by learning how to apply Boyle&rsquo;s law&mdash;a mathematical  relationship between the pressure and volume of a gas. You will also learn about  pressure measurement and how to convert from one unit to another.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is pressure?</li>
  <li>How is pressure measured?</li>
  <li>How are pressure and volume of a gas related?</li>
  <li>How are pressure-volume relationships applied in technologies to  support breathing?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 2&mdash;Kelvin Temperature, Charles&rsquo; Law,  and the Combined Gas Law</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Boyle&rsquo;s  law establishes the relationship between the pressure and volume of a gas at a  constant temperature, it may not be used if the temperature is changing. In  this lesson you will learn that Charles&rsquo; law and the combined gas law may be  used if the temperature of a gas changes. You will also learn about the Kelvin  temperature scale and how to convert from degrees Celsius (&ordm;C) to kelvin (K).</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the Kelvin temperature scale, and why is it used? </li>
  <li>What are the relationships among amount, pressure, volume, and  temperature for a fixed amount of gas? </li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 3&mdash;The Law of Combining Volumes and  Avogadro&rsquo;s Theory</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The kinetic  molecular theory has important implications for gas laws. In this lesson you  will examine <span class="nowrap">Gay-Lussac&rsquo;s</span> law of combining volumes (not to be confused with the  combined gas law) and Avogadro&rsquo;s theory.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is it possible to predict the quantity  of a gaseous substance involved in a chemical reaction? </li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 4&mdash;Molar Volume and the Ideal Gas Law</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the final  lesson of this module you will learn about the ideal gas law. This law  establishes the relationship between the molar amount of a gas and other gas  properties, such as pressure, volume, and temperature.<strong><br />
</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>What is molar volume? </li>
  <li>What is the difference between a real gas and an ideal gas?</li>
  <li>What relationship exists between pressure, volume, temperature, and  moles of gas?</li>
</ul>
