<p>Throughout this  module you are asked to consider technologies that apply the use of one or more  of the gas laws. For your combined unit and module assessment, you will prepare  a response on a technology that applies gas laws. To prepare your response,  consider the following information on compressed carbon dioxide cartridges.  Refer to the Unit Assessment section for more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compressed  carbon dioxide cartridges are a popular alternative to a hand pump for many  cyclists. Since the size of the tires and the suggested optimal inflation  pressure varies between mountain bikes and road bikes, different sizes of  cartridges are available. Each size of cartridge has a different mass of carbon  dioxide inside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Describe  advantages and disadvantages of the use of compressed carbon dioxide gas  cartridges in place of  a hand pump to inflate bicycle tires. Make sure your list  addresses at least three different perspectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Save a copy of your list in  your course folder. You may wish to use this explanation when completing the  unit assessment.</p>

<p>Throughout  this unit you have been asked to consider technologies that apply the use of  one or more of the gas laws. Consider the use of propane cylinders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does a  technician at a filling station know when a propane cylinder is full? Can you  think of how the ideal gas law applies to the filling of propane cylinders,  like the cylinders used with many gas barbeques? How is the safety of gas  cylinders determined at a filling station? Does this system have merit?</p>
