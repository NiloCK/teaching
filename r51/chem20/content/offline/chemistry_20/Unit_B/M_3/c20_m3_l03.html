<p>High-altitude ballooning creates many unique situations that must  be considered. One aspect is the quantity of available oxygen. Oxygen is  necessary for the crew to survive, and at high altitudes in the atmosphere,  oxygen is less plentiful. You may recall that hot air within the balloon is  necessary for lift. The air inside the balloon is heated by a combustion  reaction. How is this possible in the upper atmosphere with limited oxygen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may notice the large compressed gas cylinders along the side  of the <em>Breitling Orbiter 3</em>, the first hot-air balloon to circle Earth  without stopping. The gases in the Breitling orbiter balloon were heated using  a combustion reaction involving propane and oxygen. When planning the flight,  the balloonists needed to know how many canisters of each gas, propane and  oxygen, to carry. How would knowledge of gas laws assist their efforts?</p>
