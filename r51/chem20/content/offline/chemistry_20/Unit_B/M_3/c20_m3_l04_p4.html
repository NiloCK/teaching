<h3 class="unitBh3">Module 3&mdash;Behaviour of Gases</h3>
<h6><img src="../icons/read.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Read</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Real vs.  Ideal Gases</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 1 you  completed a lab investigating the relationship between pressure and volume of  two gases. Did you observe any difference in the way the gases behaved? If you  look back on your data and graphs, you will notice that the data collected for  the two gases are almost identical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This lab  demonstrated that as long as temperature was constant, and the gases were  compressed to similar volumes, they produced the same pressure. As you learned  in this module, the pressure exerted by a gas is a direct result of its motion.  When gases produce equal pressures when all other conditions are similar, it  means that the degree of motion of the two gases is the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Unit A you  learned about intermolecular forces and how attractions between atoms and  molecules in a system can influence boiling point. You might ask whether the  difference in intermolecular forces between these two gases tested would alter  their behaviour and cause a difference in the observed pressure of each gas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearly the  data from your experiment shows this is not the case, and that the gases are  behaving independent of these kinds of forces under the conditions of the  experiment. When gases do not appear to be influenced by forces between them,  along with other characteristics, they exhibit ideal behaviour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read &ldquo;The  Ideal Gas Law&rdquo; on pages 172 through 175 in your textbook. You will find  out what other conditions make the behaviour of a gas &ldquo;ideal.&rdquo; In this section  you will also learn about the development of the ideal gas law, a relationship  among all the variables you have studied in this unit: pressure, volume,  temperature, and moles of gas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carefully work  through &ldquo;SAMPLE problem 4.4,&rdquo; the &ldquo;COMMUNICATION example&rdquo; on page 174, and the  following examples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 4</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How many grams  of oxygen gas are there in a 60.0-L tank at 25.0 &deg;C when the pressure in the  tank is 12.2 MPa (MPa = megapascals)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, determine the number of moles using the ideal gas law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="left2block"><img src="../../images/m3/m3_equations/Eqn046.gif" width="258" height="132" /></div>
<p><br />
  <br />
Now, determine  the number of grams of oxygen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="left2block"><img src="../../images/m3/m3_equations/Eqn047.gif" width="177" height="84" /></div>
<div class="left2block"><img src="../../images/m3/m3_equations/Eqn048.gif" width="296" height="108" /></div>
<p><br />
    <br />
  The mass of O<span class="subscript">2</span>(g)  is 9.45 &times; 10<span class="superscript">3</span> g or 9.45 kg.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 5</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experiments  show that a reaction will produce 12.7 g of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>(g). What volume of  CO<span class="subscript">2</span>(g) should be expected at a new temperature of 40.0 &deg;C and 120.0  kPa?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, find the number of moles of carbon dioxide gas.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<div class="left2block"><img src="../../images/m3/m3_equations/Eqn049.gif" width="280" height="84" /></div>
<div class="left2block"><img src="../../images/m3/m3_equations/Eqn050.gif" width="190" height="94" /></div>
<p><br />
  <br />
</p>
<p>Now, determine the volume  using the ideal gas law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="left2block"><img src="../../images/m3/m3_equations/Eqn051.gif" width="202" height="102" /></span><br />
    <br />
    <span class="left3block"><img src="../../images/m3/m3_equations/Eqn052.gif" width="428" height="124" /></span></p>
<p><br />
    <br />
  A volume of  6.26 L of CO<span class="subscript">2</span>(g) should be expected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see  by these examples, using the ideal gas law to predict the pressure, volume, or  mass of gas can be very useful. One of the most practical reasons for using this relationship is to ensure the safety of people working with compressed  gases and to ensure that the capacity of containers is not exceeded.</p>

      <strong>SC 10.</strong> The volume of a gas in an  air (pneumatic) shock absorber can be reduced by decreasing the chemical amount  of gas, by lowering the temperature, or by raising the pressure.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SC 11.</strong></p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>First, determine the number  of moles using the ideal gas law.<br />
        <br />
        <span class="left2block"><img src="../../images/m3/m3_equations/Eqn062.gif" width="264" height="122" /></span><br />

      <br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Since the  formula is <em>X</em>H<span class="subscript">3</span>, the molar mass of the three hydrogen atoms  can be subtracted from the molar mass of the compound.<br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>34.0 g/mol &minus;  3.03 g/mol = 31.0 g/mol<br />
          <br />
        </p>
        This is the molar mass of the missing element. The element that has the  molar mass closest to 31.0 g/mol is phosphorus. Therefore, the formula for the  compound is PH<span class="subscript">3</span>.<br />
