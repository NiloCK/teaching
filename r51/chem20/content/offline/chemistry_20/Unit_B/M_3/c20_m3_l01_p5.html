<p>Respiratory  therapists evaluate and care for patients who suffer from breathing problems  due to chronic lung conditions, such as asthma and emphysema. They also work  with people involved in motor vehicle collisions, people who have heart attacks,  and premature infants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Respiratory  therapists continually work with gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. They  monitor lung capacity and work with patients to ensure they are breathing  properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Read the transcript of an <a href="c20_m3_l01_interview.html" target="_blank">interview</a> with a respiratory therapist  to see how a knowledge of the pressure-volume relationship of gases is used in  their work.

<p>Throughout  this module you will be asked to consider technologies that apply the use of  one or more of the gas laws. For your combined unit and module assessment, you  will prepare a response on a technology that applies one or more of the gas laws.  To prepare your response, consider the following description of compressed  gases. Refer to the Unit Assessment section for more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Review the technologies described in the case study on  &ldquo;Compressed Gases&rdquo; on pages 159 and 160 in your textbook. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which of the technologies in this case study involves a  pressure-volume relationship? Describe how this relationship is involved in the  operation of the technology. Save your answer in your course folder. </p>
