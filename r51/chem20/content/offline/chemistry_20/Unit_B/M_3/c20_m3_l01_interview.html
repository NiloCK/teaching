        <h6>Respiratory Therapist Interview</h6>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Student: </strong>So  you&rsquo;re a respiratory therapist. What&rsquo;s that?<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Respiratory Therapist: </strong>A  respiratory therapist provides services to clients in many locations. We  prepare health records and statistics, and we work together with members of  multidisciplinary health-care teams.&nbsp; <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Student:</strong> You mentioned  services to clients. What is the nature of the service you provide directly to  clients?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Respiratory  Therapist:</strong> In providing services to clients, we must apply specialized  knowledge and equipment. For example, in using a ventilator to physically  assist a person&rsquo;s breathing, we usually set a volume of gas that we want  delivered. In doing this, we need to be aware that as the volume increases, the  pressure in the lungs will go up. Lung disease may affect how quickly this  pressure change can occur safely. The goal is to deliver enough volume to meet  the needs of the individual while keeping the pressure to a minimum. By  carefully controlling the pressure, damage to the lungs is avoided or, at  least, minimized.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Student:</strong> What is the iron lung?  Is it still used today to help patients breathe?<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Respiratory Therapist:</strong> The iron lung enclosed a patient in a sealed steel drum with only the patient&rsquo;s  head and neck sticking out through an airtight collar. By increasing and  decreasing the air pressure around the person&rsquo;s body, the iron lung made the  chest wall and diaphragm move in and out. Although the iron lung did help people  breathe, it severely restricted mobility. Modern ventilators are less  cumbersome and have taken the place of the iron lung. <br />
            <br />
          Have you heard  of hyperbaric chambers? They fully enclose the patient but are not meant to  physically help the client breathe. In hyperbaric chambers the pressure is  maintained at an elevated level rather than at the oscillating level used in  iron lungs.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Student:</strong> How are  hyperbaric chambers used in respiratory therapy?<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Respiratory Therapist:</strong> Hyperbaric chambers are used to treat, say, someone who suffers from carbon  monoxide poisoning. Treatment with hyperbaric oxygen is the delivery of oxygen  at increased atmospheric pressure. This increase in pressure dissolves more  oxygen into the body tissue and blood so that the body is saturated with more  oxygen than normal to enhance healing. The duration of the treatment and the  pressure within the hyperbaric chamber must be appropriate for the patient and  his or her condition.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Student:</strong> Where do respiratory  therapists work?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Respiratory  Therapist:</strong> We work in a variety of settings: in hospitals, in homecare, and  in the private sector. Some respiratory therapists decide to specialize with  additional training and work as a cardiovascular perfusionist or a  polysomnographic technologist, to name a couple.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Student:</strong> What personal  characteristics are suited to this line of work?<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Respiratory Therapist:</strong> This occupation is suited to all individuals who have a genuine interest in  helping others and don&rsquo;t mind working indoors.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Student:</strong> Where would  you get the training to prepare you for this occupation?<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Respiratory Therapist:</strong> Training is available through a number of universities and technical colleges  across the country.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Student:</strong> Do I need to be  licensed as a respiratory therapist?<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Respiratory Therapist:</strong> Yes. After you&rsquo;ve graduated from an approved educational institution, you must  pass a provincial registration examination to become registered and work as a  respiratory therapist.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Student:</strong> What  employment opportunities are available?<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Respiratory Therapist:</strong> A number of employment opportunities exist both locally and abroad in hospital  and community settings.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Student:</strong> What is the  salary range for a respiratory therapist? </p>
        <br />
        <strong>Respiratory Therapist:</strong> The salary range is comparable to that of a school teacher or registered nurse.  I find this occupation to be very satisfying. I receive a decent salary in a  job that involves helping others.
