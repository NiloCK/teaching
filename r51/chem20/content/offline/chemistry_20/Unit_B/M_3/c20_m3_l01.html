When you breathe, you do so unconsciously. Even when exercising, your body automatically increases the rate at which your lungs expand and the rate at which oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged by your body. The mechanics of breathing are often overlooked, but without the action of muscles that increase the size of your rib cage, air could not be drawn into your lungs.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The mechanics of breathing illustrates one of the crucial relationships in matter. Assisting someone to breathe, either by performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or by supplying them with a compressed gas, uses the same principle as breathing normally.
