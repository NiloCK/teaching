<p>A flat tire can  be a real problem when cycling. Not only does it take time to change the tire,  but getting the inflation correct can be tricky. Riding on an underinflated  tire decreases efficiency. It may also decrease your ability to steer around  hazards in your path. Pinching the tire is one way to check the inflation of a  tire, but more often a pressure gauge is used to get an accurate reading.  Inflating a tire to the appropriate pressure involves adding air, but what  quantity of gas is necessary for proper inflation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 3 you  began to investigate the relationship between the chemical quantity of a gas  (moles) and one of its measurable properties (volume). In Lessons 1 and 2 you  investigated relationships between volume and pressure and between volume and  temperature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is also  the empirical relationship you may have already observed&mdash;adding more gas  (increasing moles) will increase the pressure exerted by gas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can all of  these relationships be combined to better explain and predict the relationship  between quantity of gas and its measurable properties?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
