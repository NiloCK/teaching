On a cold winter day in Alberta, temperatures may be around &ndash;30&deg;C. On a hot summer day in Alberta, the temperature may be around <span class="nowrap">30&deg;C.</span> Is it easier to breathe in cold weather or hot weather? You probably find that it is more difficult to breathe when it is cold outside. This isn&rsquo;t purely temperature dependent, however. Other factors, such as humidity, also affect breathing.

<img width="305" src="../../images/m3/002_balloon.jpg" alt="A photograph shows a hot air balloon floating over a lake.  The flame to heat the gases inside the balloon is visible in the space between the basket and the lower end of the balloon." height="405" />

<p>
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Inflate a balloon. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Measure the size of the balloon. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Step 3:</strong> Place the balloon into a freezer (typically around &ndash;18&deg;C), and leave it there for ten minutes. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Step 4:</strong> Remove the balloon from the freezer and quickly determine its size. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Does the balloon get bigger or smaller when it is cooled? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In Lesson 1 you learned that the pressure of a gas is the result of the collisions of the gas molecules against the surfaces of its container. Do you recall how temperature affects the motion of particles? How would this explain the change in the size of the balloon upon cooling and heating? 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The investigation you completed identifies an important relationship between temperature and volume of a gas. This relationship was first described by Jacques Charles&mdash;a French chemist, physicist, and aeronaut. In 1783, Charles made the first hot-air balloon using hydrogen gas and ascended to a height of nearly 3 km. Charles&rsquo; work with hot-air balloons set the stage for his discovery of the relationship between temperature and volume. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In this lesson you will investigate this relationship, as well as consider the relationship of pressure, volume, and temperature for a fixed amount of gas. 
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<h6>Essential Questions</h6>
<ul>
	<li>What is the Kelvin temperature scale, and why is it used? <br />
	<br />
	</li>
	<li>What are the relationships among pressure, volume, amount, and temperature for a fixed amount of gas?</li>
</ul>
