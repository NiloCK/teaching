<p>In Lessons 1  and 2 of this module you referred to the kinetic molecular theory of matter to  help you visualize the behaviour of gas particles explained by the gas laws you  have studied.&nbsp; This theory can be used to  develop a model that explains the physical behaviour of gases. In the gas  phase, all pure substances show remarkably similar physical behaviour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your  experiments conducted thus far, the relationships among pressure, volume, and  temperature by Boyle&rsquo;s law and Charles&rsquo; law were verified with all the gases  tested. What is true for nitrogen is true for oxygen, hydrogen, and any other  gas. The behaviour of gases is independent of the type of gas present. The fact  that different gases resemble each other so closely in their physical behaviour  has some interesting results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read pages 163  and 164 in your textbook to review a summary of the application of concepts of  the kinetic molecular theory to what you have learned thus far in this module.</p>

    <ol type="a">
      <li>The kinetic  molecular theory states that an increase in temperature represents an increase  in the average kinetic energy and greater average speed of the particles in the  system. Higher speeds of the particles  will result in more collisions with the container the gas is held in. The greater the number of collisions, the  greater the pressure exerted by the gas.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>Reducing the volume of the container forces  the same number of particles to be contained in a smaller space. Since the temperature remains constant, so  would their average speed, but the particles will not have to travel as far to collide with the surface of the container. The result is an  increase in the number of collisions.&nbsp;The greater the number of collisions, the greater the pressure exerted  by the gas.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>Particles of gases have greater space between  them and greater freedom of motion.&nbsp;Therefore particles of other gases are able to move into the spaces  between other gas particles to mix quickly.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li> In a hydraulic system, force applied to one  end needs to be transferred to the other end.&nbsp;  Since gases are highly compressible, the force applied would not be  efficiently transmitted as it would be with a liquid, which is not very  compressible.<br />
        <br />
        </li>
      <li>Molecules are in constant motion, and  therefore in a system containing many particles, they will collide often,  changing the direction of colliding particles and making it very difficult for  one particle to follow a straight path for a long distance. The bullet does not collide with an  object with enough mass to  change its path. Oxygen or nitrogen molecules collide with many particles that are similar in mass.</li>
