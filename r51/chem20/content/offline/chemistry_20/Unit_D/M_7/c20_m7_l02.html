In the  mid-1960s, Tang (orange drink crystals) was used by astronauts during the  Gemini spaceflights. One of the reasons for using Tang on this and current  space missions is that it helps mask the taste of the <span class="nowrap">by-products</span> in the water the astronauts drink. A second benefit is that Tang contains  high concentrations of vitamins A and C, helping astronauts meet their daily  nutritional requirements.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The nutritional information on a juice box indicates that citrus juice  is a rich source of vitamin C. The average daily requirement for vitamin C is  90 mg for men and 75 mg for women. Some juice boxes indicate that the product contains 80% of the recommended daily intake for vitamin C. If the claim on the juice box is true, how  much vitamin C must be present in the juice solution?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
How can you  verify that the quantity of vitamin C you calculated is actually present in the  juice? The obvious answer is that you would have to test the juice. As a  consumer, you may have wondered if you are really getting what you are paying  for.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
How can you  test juice to determine the concentration of vitamin C in it? In this  lesson you will learn about titration&mdash;a process routinely used to determine the  concentration of substances in a solution.
