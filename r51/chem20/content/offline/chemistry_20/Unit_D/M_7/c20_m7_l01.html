<p>
The <i>Apollo 13</i> lunar mission was one  of the defining moments in the history of space exploration. On April 11, 1970,  disaster struck when one of two oxygen tanks exploded, significantly reducing  the amount of breathable air available to the astronauts.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Because the spacecraft was over <span class="nowrap">300 000 km</span> from Earth at the time of the  explosion, there was no choice but for the mission to complete its scheduled  course.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
While the  amount of oxygen remaining in the one working tank was sufficient to last the  duration of the mission, there was another problem. Because of the explosion, the three astronauts had to move into the lunar module, a part of the spacecraft intended for only two people. With every breath the astronauts  took, they released carbon dioxide gas into the lunar module, overwhelming the capacity of the system to remove carbon dioxide from the air. Since a higher level of carbon dioxide in the air can be toxic, the challenge  facing NASA engineers on the ground was to figure out a way to control the  concentration of carbon dioxide in the air inside the spacecraft using  materials aboard the vessel.
