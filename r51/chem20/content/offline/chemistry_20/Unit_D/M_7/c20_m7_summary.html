<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quantitative  analysis involves a variety of techniques that rely on stoichiometric  relationships between substances involved in a reaction. In this module you  performed a titration using an acid and a base. You also performed a titration  to determine the quantity of vitamin C in fruit juice. By studying some of the considerations  necessary to support a journey into space, you considered the following  questions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How is stoichiometry used in the design of a chemical system?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How is stoichiometry used in the analysis of a chemical system?</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p>These questions are relevant to more than spaceflight, since the  principles of stoichiometry can be applied to any process in which different  components combine and form into new arrangements. Think about this the next time you are  preparing sandwiches or planning a picnic for a large group  of&nbsp;people. You may be surprised to  find yourself thinking in ratios that relate the number of people attending to  the number of plates required or the number of veggie burgers to be prepared.</p>
