Legend has it  that Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the Moon, was reluctant to go  into space unless Aspirin was included on the mission. Aspirin tablets&mdash;used for  relieving headaches and muscle pain&mdash;were included in the medical kit (shown  here) of the <i class="nowrap">Apollo 11</i> space  capsule and for later space missions. The key ingredient in Aspirin is  acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).

As you have discovered, titration is a process that can be used to  determine the quantity of a substance in a sample. In this lesson you will  learn more about the stoichiometry involved in the process of titration and why  titration can provide such accurate and reliable data in quantitative analyses.  You will also perform a titration of pain-relief tablets to determine the mass  of ASA present.
