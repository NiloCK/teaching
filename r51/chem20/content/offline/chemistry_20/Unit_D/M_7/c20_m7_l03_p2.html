<p>In Lesson 2 you  performed a titration of an acid using a base. During that process, many  changes occurred within the chemical system, some of which you were able to see  and others you were not. In this lesson you will apply your knowledge of  stoichiometry to explain the changes that occur within a chemical system during  a titration. To begin, read the first paragraph of <span class="nowrap">&ldquo;8.5 Acid-Base Titration  Curves and Indicators&rdquo;</span> on page 333 of your textbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Titration Curves</h6>

</div>
<p>A <strong>titration curve</strong> is a graph of the  change in pH of the system being studied as a standardized solution is added.  Recall that a titration involves adding small amounts of titrant to the test  solution. What if you had the chance to assess the changes in the system after  each addition of titrant&mdash;what would you want to measure? What would the  pattern of the change look like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h6>Graph Labels</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<img src="../../images/m7/028_graph.gif" alt="A graph of a titration is shown. The graph has 16 horizontal lines and 19 vertical lines. Further description is provided below. The x-axis is labelled Volume of 0 decimal 1 0 0 NaOH aqueous added in units of millilitres. Numbers start at 0 and increase by 5 at every second vertical line ending at 45. A label appears on the graph that reads: The x-axis is the volume of titrant added to the sample. The y-axis is labelled pH. Numbers start at 0 and increase by 1 for each horizontal line to a maximum of 15. A label appears on the graph that reads: The y-axis is the pH of the sample as the titration progresses. The title for the graph shown is Titration curve for titrating 15.0 mL of 0 decimal 100 mol/L HCl(aq) with 0 decimal 100 mol/L NaOH(aq). A label is added around the text &ldquo;15.0 mL of 0 decimal 100 mol/L HCl(aq)&rdquo; indicating that the information that goes here is the volume and concentration of the sample in the flask. A label is added to the text: &ldquo;0 decimal 100 mol/L NaOH(aq)&rdquo; indicating that the information that goes here is the concentration of the titrant (in the burette)." width="491" height="440" /> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Axes Labels:</strong> The <em>x</em>-axis represents  the volume of titrant added to the sample (usually in mL). The<em> y</em>-axis represents the pH of the sample  as the titration progresses.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> The title identifies  the reactants.</p>

<h6>Drawing a Titration Curve</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this  activity you will draw a titration curve using the data you generate in a  virtual titration experiment. Combining acids and bases causes neutralization  and, therefore, a change in the pH of the solution. To monitor the progress of  your titration, you will record pH throughout the titration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong> <br />
    <br />
  You will draw a titration curve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong> <br />
    <br />
  What is the shape of a titration curve?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Construct  a data table like the following.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table width="90%" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="2">
  <tr>
    <td width="197" class="tablehead_ud"><p align="center"><strong>Volume of Titrant Added</strong> </p></td>
    <td width="197" class="tablehead_ud"><p align="center"><strong>pH of Test Solution</strong> </p></td>
    <td width="197" class="tablehead_ud"><p align="center"><strong>Indicator Colour</strong> </p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="197"><p>&nbsp;</p></td>
    <td width="197"><p>&nbsp;</p></td>
    <td width="197"><p>&nbsp;</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Title the data  table &ldquo;Titration of HCl(aq) with 1.0-mol/L NaOH(aq).&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Open  the &ldquo;<a href="javascript:full('../../mm/LateNite/main.html?labId=titration_of_an_acid');">Titration of an Acid</a>&rdquo; virtual lab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Read  the instructions and complete Procedures 1 and 2 as described in the  instructions. As you proceed through the titration, record your observations in  the appropriate places in your data table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Use  graph paper or a computer program to construct a graph of pH (vertical axis)  versus Volume of 1.0-mol/L NaOH(aq) Added (horizontal axis).&nbsp; If you are having trouble making a graph on your computer you may want to try the MSWord template.&nbsp; Click on the following link to get the template.&nbsp; <a href="../../../graphing_tool.doc" target="_blank">MSWord graphing tool</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: </strong>On  the graph, label where the colour change of the phenolphthalein indicator  occurred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Add  a suitable title, and ensure the features of your graph are appropriately  labelled.  Save your work in your course folder.</p>
