<h3 class="unitDh3">Module 7&mdash;Chemical Analysis</h3>
<h4>Module Introduction</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 6 you  learned to use the stoichiometric method to predict the quantities of the  reactants and products involved in a chemical reaction. In this module you will  continue to apply your ability to analyze chemical systems using mathematical  relationships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible  to predict the amount of product that would result if you were given defined  quantities of each reactant? You will perform a titration, which is a standard  laboratory technique used for chemical analysis. You will then use the results  from your titration to communicate information to others about the  substance tested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think  about the following questions as you complete this module: </p>
<ul>
  <li>    How is stoichiometry used in the design of a chemical system?</li>
  <li>How is stoichiometry used in the analysis of a chemical system?  </li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>In Module 6 you explored one of the greatest achievements of humans&mdash;the ability to  explore space. As you found in your study, successful space travel depends heavily on  life-support systems. Many of these systems are  developed using stoichiometric principles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you will see in this module, the careful planning and design of  life-support systems must involve a knowledge of chemical systems and the  quantities of substances involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>Even if you are not  planning to travel into space anytime soon, you may have concerns about the  food space travellers eat or the environment in which they live. Quantitative  techniques are used to monitor the nutritional content of foods and the  concentration of toxic substances present in the environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this module you will apply your knowledge of stoichiometry and explore  how stoichiometry is used in the design and analysis of a variety of chemical  systems.<br />
</p>
<h4>In This Module</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson 1&mdash;Limiting Reagents</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The focus of  this lesson is to learn how to apply your knowledge of stoichiometry to  determine which reactant will be the first to deplete during a chemical  reaction. Understanding the calculations used to determine the limiting reagent  can be applied to a variety of situations, including specifying the quantities of  reactants that should be used in  a laboratory procedure that you design and determining the necessary quantities of chemicals used in a  life-support system for a spacecraft.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    <p>How can limiting reagents be used to predict the amount of product  for a chemical process? </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 2&mdash;Titration Analysis</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson  you will learn about titration, which is a process used to determine the  quantity of substance in a test sample. Although many methods can be used to  determine quantity, titration is one of the most reliable and easily performed  experimental procedures. You will see how your knowledge of stoichiometry can  be used to analyze the data collected during a titration experiment. In  addition, you will see how titration can be used to study an acid-base chemical  system and other chemical systems.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How can titration be used to calculate the quantity of solute  within a solution?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 3&mdash;Titration Curves and Selecting  Indicators</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 2 you  performed a titration. In this lesson you will construct a graph depicting the  changes in concentration of key components in a chemical reaction. This graph  is called a titration curve. You will also interpret a titration curve and  identify aspects of this graph that demonstrate significant features of the  chemical reaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 5 you  used indicators to determine the pH of a solution, and in Lesson 2 you  used an indicator to identify the endpoint of a titration reaction. In this  lesson you will learn how to use your titration curve to select appropriate indicators  for a titration, allowing for precise and sensitive detection of the completion  of a chemical reaction.</p>
<ul>
  <li>How are titration graphs drawn?</li>
  <li>How do you select an appropriate indicator for a titration?<br />
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>Apollo 13</em> lunar mission was one  of the defining moments in the history of space exploration. On April 11, 1970,  disaster struck when one of two oxygen tanks exploded, significantly reducing  the amount of breathable air available to the astronauts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the spacecraft was over <span class="nowrap">300 000 km</span> from Earth at the time of the  explosion, there was no choice but for the mission to complete its scheduled  course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the  amount of oxygen remaining in the one working tank was sufficient to last the  duration of the mission, there was another problem. Because of the explosion, the three astronauts had to move into the lunar module, a part of the spacecraft intended for only two people. With every breath the astronauts  took, they released carbon dioxide gas into the lunar module, overwhelming the capacity of the system to remove carbon dioxide from the air. Since a higher level of carbon dioxide in the air can be toxic, the challenge  facing NASA engineers on the ground was to figure out a way to control the  concentration of carbon dioxide in the air inside the spacecraft using  materials aboard the vessel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How did they do  it?</p>

<h6>Limiting and Excess Reagents</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 6 you  learned that baking powder is a combination of sodium hydrogen carbonate  (baking soda) and potassium hydrogen tartrate (cream of tartar). Although these  two substances are present in stoichiometric proportions in baking powder, what  would be the result if one component were in excess relative to the other  component?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recall from  your study in Module 5 that an excess of the sodium hydrogen carbonate&mdash;a basic  compound known to have a bitter taste&mdash;could alter the taste of the food being  baked. Similarly, an excess of potassium hydrogen tartrate could leave the  finished product with a different undesirable taste, or it could allow for an  unexpected reaction to occur with another ingredient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you  considered what effect a deficiency of one component relative to another might  have on the quantity of carbon dioxide produced by the reaction? A cake that  doesn&rsquo;t rise to its desired height or texture may have been the unfortunate result of a  component in the recipe being in a limited quantity relative  to the other components.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you use  your knowledge of stoichiometry to design a reaction that will ensure that it  is a complete reaction?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read  &ldquo;Calculating Mass of Excess Reagents&rdquo; on page 320 of your textbook. Then work  through &ldquo;SAMPLE problem 8.1.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Have you ever ridden in a vehicle that ran out of gas before reaching the planned destination? A situation like this quickly reminds you that  depleting one of the reactants in a chemical process causes the reaction to  quit. Chemical reactions don&rsquo;t have a fuel gauge like a vehicle does, so how can you use your  knowledge of stoichiometry to identify the limiting reagent in a reaction?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read &ldquo;Identifying Limiting and Excess Reagents&rdquo; on pages 321 to 323 of  your textbook. Work through &ldquo;SAMPLE problems&rdquo; 8.2 and 8.3 and the &ldquo;COMMUNICATION example.&rdquo; </p>

</div>
<p>In the  mid-1960s, Tang (orange drink crystals) was used by astronauts during the  Gemini spaceflights. One of the reasons for using Tang on this and current  space missions is that it helps mask the taste of the <span class="nowrap">by-products</span> in the water the astronauts drink. A second benefit is that Tang contains  high concentrations of vitamins A and C, helping astronauts meet their daily  nutritional requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nutritional information on a juice box indicates that citrus juice  is a rich source of vitamin C. The average daily requirement for vitamin C is  90 mg for men and 75 mg for women. Some juice boxes indicate that the product contains 80% of the recommended daily intake for vitamin C. If the claim on the juice box is true, how  much vitamin C must be present in the juice solution?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can you  verify that the quantity of vitamin C you calculated is actually present in the  juice? The obvious answer is that you would have to test the juice. As a  consumer, you may have wondered if you are really getting what you are paying  for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can you  test juice to determine the concentration of vitamin C in it? In this  lesson you will learn about titration&mdash;a process routinely used to determine the  concentration of substances in a solution.</p>

  <p><strong>titration:</strong> a method of analyzing a solution by adding known  amounts of a standardized solution until an endpoint is produced</p>
</div>
<p>A <strong>titration</strong> is a method of  analyzing a solution by adding known amounts of a standardized solution until  an endpoint is produced. This laboratory procedure is used to determine the  concentration of a solute in a solution being tested. In Lesson 1 you  studied the limiting reagent and how it influences the predictions made using  stoichiometry. A titration involves the careful addition of one reactant to another  to determine the exact point where one reactant becomes excess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read page 328  of &ldquo;8.4 Titration Analysis&rdquo; in your textbook to become familiar with some of  the terms used in a titration analysis.</p>

<p>Reading the  level of the solution in the burette is an essential skill. To practise this  skill, view the video a second time, pausing the video so you are able to read  the solution level in the burette at the start and at the end of the trial.  Compare the burette readings you made to the values stated in the video. </p>

<p>In the  &ldquo;Performing a Titration&rdquo; video, you watched NaOH(aq) solution being added to an  HCl(aq) acid solution until a permanent change in the colour of the bromothymol  blue indicator occurred. How does the colour change for bromothymol blue signal  the detection of the end of the reaction?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recall from  your study in Module 4 that bromothymol blue appears yellow in acidic solutions  and blue in basic solutions. As shown in the video, a titration proceeds until  an endpoint is reached. In this case, the excess NaOH(aq) added after all the  acid in the sample had reacted creates a basic solution, causing the indicator  to change colour.</p>

<p>Titrations can  provide very accurate data. One means to ensure accuracy is by doing multiple  trials. Multiple trials allow for selecting the most consistent trials for  further analysis. One sign of consistency is obtaining a similar endpoint  colour between trials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Work through &ldquo;SAMPLE problem 8.4&rdquo; on page 329 of your textbook  to see how titration data from multiple trials is analyzed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After working  through this sample problem, you may wonder why only three trials were required  in this titration. As stated earlier, a titration is repeated until consistent  results are obtained, such as endpoint colour and titrant volumes that are  within 0.2 mL of each other.</p>

<h6> <img src="../icons/lab_icon_flask.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Lab: Determining the Quantity of Vitamin C in Fruit Juice</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A titration  does not always have to involve an acid-base reaction. Analyze the information  provided about a titration to determine the concentration of vitamin C in fruit  juice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Vitamin C, also called  ascorbic acid, is commonly found in commercial fruit juices and drinks. In this  activity you will analyze data collected from a titration analysis of a fruit  juice.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <div class="left1block"><img src="../../images/m7/019_juice_label.jpg" alt="The nutrition facts for a 200-mL juice box are shown. The value most important to this investigation is for vitamin C. The value given for vitamin C is 80% of the daily value." width="160" height="314" /></div>
        <div class="left2block"><img src="../../images/m7/020_compound.jpg" alt="A structural diagram for vitamin C is shown, along with the molar mass of vitamin C, 176.14 g/mol." width="189" height="175" /></div>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p><strong>Background Information</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ascorbic acid reacts with  iodine in solution, as described by the following reaction:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center">ascorbic acid(aq) + I<span class="subscript">2</span>(aq) &rarr;  dehydroascorbic acid(aq) + 2 I<span class="superscript">&minus;</span>(aq)</p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In this procedure a standard  aqueous iodine solution is added to a sample of juice. The initial reaction  involves iodine reacting until the ascorbic acid in the juice sample depletes.  The endpoint of this titration is a blue colour, signified by the reaction of  excess iodine with starch (which is added to the juice prior to titration).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Earlier in this lesson you  read that the  average daily requirement for vitamin C is  90 mg for men and 75 mg for women.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The purpose of this  investigation is to test the manufacturer&rsquo;s claim that the juice product  contains 80% of the daily recommended amount of ascorbic acid.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What mass of vitamin C  (ascorbic acid) is present in a box of juice?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Assemble the ring stand and burette clamp. Clean the burette using distilled  water, and wash using a small quantity of the aqueous iodine solution. Place  the burette in the clamp.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Fill the burette with the aqueous iodine solution.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Read and record the volume in the burette.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Clean the pipette using distilled water, and wash using a small quantity of the  fruit juice. Use the pipette to transfer 10.00 mL of juice to the Erlenmeyer  flask.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add a few drops of the starch indicator solution to the Erlenmeyer flask.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Add 40 mL of distilled water to the Erlenmeyer flask.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Titrate the juice sample to the desired endpoint&mdash;a permanent dark blue colour.  Measure and record the burette reading at the endpoint. Record the endpoint  colour.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Repeat steps 3 to 7 three more times (four trials altogether).</p>

        <p>The following questions are  to be answered in your Module 7: Lesson 2 Assignment.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Read the background information and procedure for  this investigation. Compare and contrast this procedure with the titration you  performed earlier.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>Use the data to calculate the average number of moles  of ascorbic acid present in the titrated samples.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>The volume of juice tested was 10.00 mL. What amount  of ascorbic acid would be ingested if the entire juice box (200 mL) were  consumed?<br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>Calculate  the mass of ascorbic acid in the juice box. Compare this value to the mass of  vitamin C you expected in the juice if it met the 80% of the daily recommended amount.</li>
        </ol>
      <p>Use the data provided  to answer  question 2 in the Module 7 Lesson 2 Assignment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Lesson Summary</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In this lesson you explored the following essential question: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How can titration be used to calculate the quantity of  solute in a solution?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You performed a  titration and analyzed the data collected during a titration experiment.  Titration analysis can be used to verify the concentration of a substance  in a solution or commercial product. Through your work in determining the  mass of vitamin C in a juice box, you learned that the techniques involved in  titrations can be used in situations other than acid-base reactions.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the next  lesson you will learn more about the design of a titration experiment and why  it allows for precise determination of a solute&rsquo;s concentration.</p>

<p>Legend has it  that Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the Moon, was reluctant to go  into space unless Aspirin was included on the mission. Aspirin tablets&mdash;used for  relieving headaches and muscle pain&mdash;were included in the medical kit (shown  here) of the <em class="nowrap">Apollo 11</em> space  capsule and for later space missions. The key ingredient in Aspirin is  acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you have discovered, titration is a process that can be used to  determine the quantity of a substance in a sample. In this lesson you will  learn more about the stoichiometry involved in the process of titration and why  titration can provide such accurate and reliable data in quantitative analyses.  You will also perform a titration of pain-relief tablets to determine the mass  of ASA present.</p>

<p>In Lesson 2 you  performed a titration of an acid using a base. During that process, many  changes occurred within the chemical system, some of which you were able to see  and others you were not. In this lesson you will apply your knowledge of  stoichiometry to explain the changes that occur within a chemical system during  a titration. To begin, read the first paragraph of <span class="nowrap">&ldquo;8.5 Acid-Base Titration  Curves and Indicators&rdquo;</span> on page 333 of your textbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Titration Curves</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right1blockD">
  <p><strong>titration curve:</strong> a graph of the change in pH of the system being  studied as standardized solution is added</p>
</div>
<p>A <strong>titration curve</strong> is a graph of the  change in pH of the system being studied as a standardized solution is added.  Recall that a titration involves adding small amounts of titrant to the test  solution. What if you had the chance to assess the changes in the system after  each addition of titrant&mdash;what would you want to measure? What would the  pattern of the change look like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h6>Graph Labels</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<img src="../../images/m7/028_graph.gif" alt="A graph of a titration is shown. The graph has 16 horizontal lines and 19 vertical lines. Further description is provided below. The x-axis is labelled Volume of 0 decimal 1 0 0 NaOH aqueous added in units of millilitres. Numbers start at 0 and increase by 5 at every second vertical line ending at 45. A label appears on the graph that reads: The x-axis is the volume of titrant added to the sample. The y-axis is labelled pH. Numbers start at 0 and increase by 1 for each horizontal line to a maximum of 15. A label appears on the graph that reads: The y-axis is the pH of the sample as the titration progresses. The title for the graph shown is Titration curve for titrating 15.0 mL of 0 decimal 100 mol/L HCl(aq) with 0 decimal 100 mol/L NaOH(aq). A label is added around the text &ldquo;15.0 mL of 0 decimal 100 mol/L HCl(aq)&rdquo; indicating that the information that goes here is the volume and concentration of the sample in the flask.

<h6>Drawing a Titration Curve</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this  activity you will draw a titration curve using the data you generate in a  virtual titration experiment. Combining acids and bases causes neutralization  and, therefore, a change in the pH of the solution. To monitor the progress of  your titration, you will record pH throughout the titration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong> <br />
    <br />
  You will draw a titration curve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong> <br />
    <br />
  What is the shape of a titration curve?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Construct  a data table like the following.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table width="90%" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="2">
  <tr>
    <td width="197" class="tablehead_ud"><p align="center"><strong>Volume of Titrant Added</strong> </p></td>
    <td width="197" class="tablehead_ud"><p align="center"><strong>pH of Test Solution</strong> </p></td>
    <td width="197" class="tablehead_ud"><p align="center"><strong>Indicator Colour</strong> </p></td>
  </tr>

    <td width="197"><p>&nbsp;</p></td>
    <td width="197"><p>&nbsp;</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Title the data  table &ldquo;Titration of HCl(aq) with 1.0-mol/L NaOH(aq).&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Click on Module 7 Lesson 3 Page 2 on your DVD. Open  the &quot;Titration of an Acid&quot; virtual lab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Read  the instructions and complete Procedures 1 and 2 as described in the  instructions. As you proceed through the titration, record your observations in  the appropriate places in your data table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Use  graph paper or a computer program to construct a graph of pH (vertical axis)  versus Volume of 1.0-mol/L NaOH(aq) Added (horizontal axis).&nbsp; If you are having trouble making a graph on your computer you may want to try the MSWord template.&nbsp; Click on the &quot;MSWord graphing tool&quot; to get the template.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: </strong>On  the graph, label where the colour change of the phenolphthalein indicator  occurred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Add  a suitable title, and ensure the features of your graph are appropriately  labelled.  Save your work in your course folder.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The unique  shape of a titration curve demonstrates that important changes occur.  Interpreting the different parts of a titration curve is an important skill.  Read  &ldquo;Interpreting Titration pH Curves&rdquo; on <span class="nowrap">pages  334</span> and 335 of the textbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will note that a titration curve conveys a great deal of information  about the chemical reaction that occurred to produce this data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A very  important piece of information on the graph is the equivalence point. The  equivalence point represents the end of the reaction and is located at the  midpoint of the steep middle region. While the titration graph for a strong  monoprotic acid reacting with a strong monoprotic base will have an equivalence  point pH of 7, this is not necessarily the case for weak acids or weak bases  being titrated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The volume of  titrant required to reach the equivalence point is the value used to complete  calculations like those you have completed in the previous lessons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The titration  data and the completed titration curve are shown here for comparison.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h6>Selecting Indicators for a Titration Curve</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you titrate  HCl(aq) with NaOH(aq)&mdash;two colourless solutions&mdash;without using an indicator, there will be no  colour change to signify that the equivalence point has been reached.  Indicators respond to changes in pH and provide a dramatic colour change to  signify the endpoint of a titration. But with so many indicators to choose  from, which one is best?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read &ldquo;Choosing  Acid-Base Indicators for Titration&rdquo; on page 336 of your textbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good rule of  thumb for selecting an indicator is that the midpoint pH of the range of colour  change is equal to the equivalence point pH.</p>

<p><strong>SC 2. </strong>Refer back to the titration curves you drew for Lab 10: Titration of Strong and Weak Acids. Use the information provided in the &ldquo;Acid-Base  Indicators&rdquo; table in the Chemistry Data Booklet to identify suitable indicators  that will signify the endpoint for each of the titrations. Then indicate the  colour change that would signify the endpoint of the titration.</p>

<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Lesson Summary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson you extended your knowledge of titrations by learning how  to analyze titration curves. The data for a titration curve can be obtained by  using a pH meter to record the pH while a sample is being titrated. One of the  most important parts of a titration curve is the equivalence point, located at  the midpoint of the steep middle region. The equivalence point signifies the  completion of the reaction. The volume of titrant required to reach the  equivalence point is used to complete calculations involved in quantitative analysis.  The pH at the equivalence point is used to select an appropriate indicator for  the titration. In Reflect and Connect, you applied your knowledge of titration  analysis to determine the amount of ASA (acetylsalicylic acid) present in a  tablet of Aspirin.</p>

<h4>Module Summary and Assessment</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Module Summary</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quantitative  analysis involves a variety of techniques that rely on stoichiometric  relationships between substances involved in a reaction. In this module you  performed a titration using an acid and a base. You also performed a titration  to determine the quantity of vitamin C in fruit juice. By studying some of the considerations  necessary to support a journey into space, you considered the following  questions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How is stoichiometry used in the design of a chemical system?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How is stoichiometry used in the analysis of a chemical system?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>These questions are relevant to more than spaceflight, since the  principles of stoichiometry can be applied to any process in which different  components combine and form into new arrangements. Think about this the next time you are  preparing sandwiches or planning a picnic for a large group  of&nbsp;people. You may be surprised to  find yourself thinking in ratios that relate the number of people attending to  the number of plates required or the number of veggie burgers to be prepared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The assessment  in this module consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Module 7: Lesson 1 Assignment</li>
  <li>Module 7: Lesson 2 Assignment</li>
  <li>Module 7: Lesson 3 Assignment</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unitDh3">Unit D Conclusion</h3>
<p>In Module 6 you  applied the stoichiometric method to examine a number of chemical systems,  including the chemical reaction involved in launching the Space Shuttle. You  learned that careful consideration of chemical quantities is essential to  ensuring the desired result for a chemical process. In Module 7 you learned how  important it is to consider appropriate chemical quantities in the designs of the  chemical systems within a spacecraft and  in other situations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of  whether a substance was a solid, a gas, or dissolved within a solution,  predictions made using stoichiometry were confirmed by the experiments you  performed. You also learned that stoichiometric relationships can be shown in a  graph, such as a titration curve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Knowledge of  the relationships that involve the quantities of substances involved in a  reaction, in addition to the ability to apply the stoichiometric method and  perform calculations, is an essential skill you will need in Chemistry 30.</p>
