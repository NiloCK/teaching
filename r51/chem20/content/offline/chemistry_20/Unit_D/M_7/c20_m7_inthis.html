<h3 class="unitDh3">Module 7&mdash;Chemical Analysis</h3>
<h4>In This Module</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson 1&mdash;Limiting Reagents</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The focus of  this lesson is to learn how to apply your knowledge of stoichiometry to  determine which reactant will be the first to deplete during a chemical  reaction. Understanding the calculations used to determine the limiting reagent  can be applied to a variety of situations, including specifying the quantities of  reactants that should be used in  a laboratory procedure that you design and determining the necessary quantities of chemicals used in a  life-support system for a spacecraft.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    <p>How can limiting reagents be used to predict the amount of product  for a chemical process? </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 2&mdash;Titration Analysis</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson  you will learn about titration, which is a process used to determine the  quantity of substance in a test sample. Although many methods can be used to  determine quantity, titration is one of the most reliable and easily performed  experimental procedures. You will see how your knowledge of stoichiometry can  be used to analyze the data collected during a titration experiment. In  addition, you will see how titration can be used to study an acid-base chemical  system and other chemical systems.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How can titration be used to calculate the quantity of solute  within a solution?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 3&mdash;Titration Curves and Selecting  Indicators</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Lesson 2 you  performed a titration. In this lesson you will construct a graph depicting the  changes in concentration of key components in a chemical reaction. This graph  is called a titration curve. You will also interpret a titration curve and  identify aspects of this graph that demonstrate significant features of the  chemical reaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Module 5 you  used indicators to determine the pH of a solution, and in Lesson 2 you  used an indicator to identify the endpoint of a titration reaction. In this  lesson you will learn how to use your titration curve to select appropriate indicators  for a titration, allowing for precise and sensitive detection of the completion  of a chemical reaction.</p>
<ul>
  <li>How are titration graphs drawn?</li>
  <li>How do you select an appropriate indicator for a titration?<br />
    </li>
  </ul>
