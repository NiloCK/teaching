Constructing and supporting the International Space  Station is a huge effort. Supplies are delivered to the station by  the Space Shuttle or by Russian spacecraft. How much fuel and how many other  reactants are required to launch a rocket? What is the risk of not transporting  materials and supplies, like food, to the station?

In this unit  you will add to your understanding of quantitative properties of chemical  processes. You will learn to predict and analyze the quantities of substances  that participate in chemical reactions, a skill  used by scientists,  engineers, and technicians involved in spaceflight. You will also learn to consider a chemical  system as a converter of matter, and you will see what influence the reactants of a process  have on the products that result.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The major  concepts developed in this unit will allow you to
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
	explain how balanced chemical equations indicate the quantitative  relationships among reactants and products involved in chemical changes<br />
	  
	<br />
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	use stoichiometry in quantitative analyses of chemical systems
	</p>
	</li>
</ul>
