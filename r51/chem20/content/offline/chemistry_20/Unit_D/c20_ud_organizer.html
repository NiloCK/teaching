<h6>Module 6&mdash;Stoichiometry</h6>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
This module  introduces the stoichiometric method&mdash;an approach for predicting the quantities  of substances that will participate in a chemical reaction. You will learn how  to apply your knowledge of quantitative relationships to solids, gases, and  aqueous solutions. Through the completion of experimental work, you will test  the predictions made using the stoichiometric method in order to verify that  this method works.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The essential questions you will investigate in  this module are
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
	How do scientists and engineers use mathematics when analyzing  chemical change?<br />
	<br />
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	How is a balanced chemical equation used to predict quantities of  species involved in a chemical process?
	</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h6>Module 7&mdash;Chemical Analysis</h6>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The accurate  determination of quantities of substances is an important aspect of the design  of a chemical system. Careful consideration of the quantities of reactants  involved in industrial applications ensures the greatest possible yield of products. In  environmental systems, well-tried methods and technology  allow for  accurate and sensitive detection of chemical quantities, often at extremely low  concentrations.
