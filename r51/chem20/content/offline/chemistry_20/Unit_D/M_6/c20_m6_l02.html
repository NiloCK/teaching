In Lesson 1 you  learned that stoichiometry is a method to predict the quantities of reactants  or products involved in a chemical reaction. Whether you plan to launch a  rocket, and need to calculate oxygen to fuel ratios, or need to calculate the  quantity of product that will result from a chemical reaction, a knowledge of  stoichiometry is essential. In Lesson 1 you concentrated on the significance of  ratios among the coefficients of different substances in the reaction to this  method of calculation.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
There are two  major drawbacks to the predictions you have made thus far. First, you have only  been able to consider chemical quantities of each substance (number of moles)  involved. You already know that the number of moles is not a directly  measurable quantity. Second, as is the case with all predictions, they need to  be confirmed.

<p>
<b>gravimetric analysis:</b>  the determination  of masses of substances
</p>
</div>
<p>
In this lesson  you will continue your study of stoichiometry by learning how to use the masses  of the substances involved in your predictions. You will also perform an  experiment to test predictions made using stoichiometry. By completing these  activities, you will perform a <b>gravimetric</b> <b>analysis</b>. Gravimetric analyses involve the  determination of masses of substances. Open the following sound file to  hear how this word is pronounced.
