<h3 class="unitDh3">Module 6&mdash;Stoichiometry</h3>
<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Lesson Summary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In  this lesson you explored the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What information about a chemical system is contained within a  balanced chemical equation?<br />
      <br />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What information about a chemical system is not contained within a  balanced chemical equation?<br />
      <br />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is conservation of mass, and how is it demonstrated in a  chemical equation?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>You were  introduced to stoichiometry, a mathematical process to determine quantities of  substances involved in a chemical process. You learned that the information  contained within balanced chemical equations provides information about  chemical quantities, such as the number of moles of substances involved. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You  discovered that the coefficients of a balanced chemical equation describe the  proportions of each substance involved in the reaction, and how these  proportions are an essential part of the predictions made using stoichiometry. </p>
<p>You learned  that analyzing a system in terms of number of moles of substances does not  allow you to comment on measurable quantities like mass or volume. In the  lessons to come, you will extend your understanding of stoichiometry to use  measurements of matter to predict the outcomes of a variety of chemical  reactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson  Glossary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>law of conservation of mass:</strong>  a law stating that in any  physical or chemical system, the initial mass of the system will be identical  to the final mass of the system</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>mole ratio:</strong> a mathematical statement of  the proportion of each substance involved in a chemical process relative to one  another</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>net ionic equation:</strong> a type of balanced chemical  equation that lists only the reacting particles</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>stoichiometry:</strong> a method of predicting or  analyzing the quantities of the reactants and products participating in a  chemical process</p>
