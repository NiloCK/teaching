<p>In Lesson 1 of  this module you examined the chemical reaction that occurs in the main engines  of the Space Shuttle.</p>
<p align="center"><br />
  2 H<span class="subscript">2</span>(l) + O<span class="subscript">2</span>(l) &rarr; 2 H<span class="subscript">2</span>O(g)  </p>
</p>
<p>  <br />
  From your work in Lesson 1, you identified important aspects of this balanced  chemical equation, such as the mole ratio for hydrogen and oxygen. You would  correctly interpret this ratio as meaning that twice as many moles of hydrogen  than oxygen are needed  for this reaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What would happen if a model for this reaction were to be planned using  2.0 g of hydrogen and 1.0 g of oxygen? Would the proper stoichiometric ratio  for the reaction be met? Read and follow the calculations given in the table to  answer this question.</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Compare the  mole ratio calculated from the masses of each reactant with the desired mole  ratio from the balanced chemical equation. Would the correct proportion of  hydrogen be used in this model reaction? Can you provide an explanation as to  why the correct proportion of these two reactants could not be met?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you may have  identified in the previous example, hydrogen and oxygen have significantly  different molar masses. This was not accounted for when suggesting masses of  each gas to use in the model reaction. As a result, there are very different  numbers of moles for the two reactants. What effect would completing this  reaction with these masses have?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="right1blockD">
  <p><strong>yield of a reaction:</strong> a measured quantity of product obtained by a  chemical reaction often expressed as a percentage of maximum yield</p>
</div>
<p>If the reaction  were allowed to occur with the masses suggested, a large amount of hydrogen  would not have reacted, simply because not enough oxygen was present. In Module  7 you will learn more about how using quantities of reactants that are not  stoichiometric can affect the <strong>yield of a reaction</strong>. The yield of a  reaction is a measured quantity of product obtained by a chemical reaction. It is  often expressed as a percentage of maximum yield. You may have also thought  that since all the hydrogen was not able to react, a much reduced quantity of  energy would have been produced by the reaction as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What mass of  hydrogen would be required to react with all the oxygen in the model reaction?  How could you use your knowledge of stoichiometry to calculate this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By examining  this example, you have seen that making predictions using stoichiometry must  always focus on the number of moles of each substance involved. Unfortunately,  there is no device to measure the number of moles of each substance. Therefore,  to complete predictions using stoichiometry when provided the mass of a  substance involved, convert the mass into number of moles using this  relationship:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../../images/m6/m6_equations/Eqn_021.gif" width="46" height="34" /></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Work through  the following example to see how stoichiometric predictions can be made when  you are provided with the mass of one reactant in a chemical reaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example  1: </strong>For  testing a rocket engine, what mass of hydrogen gas is required to completely  react with 1.0 g of oxygen gas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Write  the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">2 H<span class="subscript">2</span>(g) + O<span class="subscript">2</span>(g) &rarr; 2 H<span class="subscript">2</span>O(g)</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Organize the information provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" width="75%">
  <tr>
    <td class="tablehead_ud"><p align="center"><strong>2 H<span class="subscript">2</span>(g)</strong> </p></td>
    <td class="tablehead_ud"><p align="center"><strong>+</strong></p></td>
    <td class="tablehead_ud"><p align="center"><strong>O<span class="subscript">2</span>(g)</strong> </p></td>
    <td class="tablehead_ud"><p align="center"><strong>&rarr;</strong></p></td>
    <td class="tablehead_ud"><p align="center"><strong>2 H<span class="subscript">2</span>O(g)</strong> </p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Calculate the number of  moles of oxygen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/m6/m6_equations/Eqn_024.gif" width="114" height="93" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Use  the mole ratio between hydrogen and oxygen to determine the number of moles of  hydrogen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/m6/m6_equations/Eqn_025.gif" width="168" height="121" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Calculate  the mass of hydrogen required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="../../images/m6/m6_equations/Eqn_026.gif" width="201" height="102" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To completely  react 1.0 g of oxygen gas, 0.13 g of hydrogen gas are required.</p>
