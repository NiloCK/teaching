<p>
The hydrogen  and oxygen that power the main engines of the Space Shuttle during launch are  placed into the large orange external fuel tank mounted to the shuttle (as seen  in this photo). The white ring that appears at the top of the external fuel  tank is used to transfer hydrogen and oxygen (as liquids) into the tank.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In Lesson 2 you  discovered that stoichiometry can be used to predict the mass of each of these  substances that needs to be placed into the external fuel tank. During the  combustion of hydrogen and oxygen, the temperature of the main engines of the  shuttle can exceed 3300&deg;C. At these conditions, the water produced by the reaction  would exist as a gas. As you may recall from your study in Module 4, gases may  fluctuate in volume in response to the temperature and pressure at which they  are contained.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Predicting the quantity of a gas that is involved in a chemical reaction  must still involve the number of moles of substance; but, in this case, the  number of moles will be measured using the pressure, volume, and temperature of  the gas. Can you recall a relationship that includes these four variables? How  would you use this relationship when predicting the quantity of a gaseous  substance involved in a chemical reaction?
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In this lesson  you will use stoichiometry to predict the quantities of substances in chemical  reactions that involve gases.
