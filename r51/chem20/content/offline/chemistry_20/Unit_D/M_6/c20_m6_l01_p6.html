<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does your  understanding of stoichiometry help you understand a chemical system with an  intended purpose? Earlier in this lesson you learned that the quantities of  reactants involved in a chemical reaction can influence the quantities of  products. You also learned that knowledge of the ratio by which substances  react is important in the design of a reaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How is an  understanding of stoichiometry used in cooking? In Module 5, <span class="nowrap">Lesson 2</span>, you  experimented with baking soda, and you found that it would produce carbon  dioxide gas with the addition of water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another  commonly used baking product is baking powder, which contains sodium hydrogen  carbonate and tartaric acid mixed together as solids. In what proportions must  the components be present in order for baking powder to achieve its desired  purpose? How does the design of baking powder represent an understanding of  stoichiometry and provide convenience for people using the product?</p>
