<p>Have you ever  had the opportunity to watch a launch of the Space Shuttle in person? The  ability to launch rockets that leave Earth&rsquo;s surface and travel into space is  one of humankind&rsquo;s greatest achievements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The video below provides a close-up of a Space Shuttle launch from a unique perspective.  This video comes from cameras located at various positions on the solid rocket  booster engines, which are the long white cylinders that are located on each  side of the large, orange main fuel tank. The table that appears below the video provides more information about what you are seeing in the video.<br />

<p>Extremely vigorous chemical  reactions take place in the rocket engines of the Space Shuttle. The solid  rocket booster engines use one type of fuel, whereas the reaction that occurs  in the main engines uses hydrogen and oxygen gases, which are contained in  the large orange tank attached to the shuttle. How much hydrogen and oxygen is  necessary to propel the Space Shuttle into space? Is a similar quantity of each  gas required? How can the balanced chemical equation (shown below) of the  reaction that occurs in the main engines provide you with information about the  quantity of each gas required to perform this operation?</p>

<p>Examining  chemical reactions using stoichiometry&mdash;an approach that considers the  quantities of substances involved in a reaction&mdash;will be helpful. In order to  learn about stoichiometry you will need to remind yourself of how to write,  balance, and classify chemical reactions so that you can use them to interpret  a chemical system. In this module you will learn to calculate the quantities of  reactants and products involved in a chemical process, along with using  calculations of percent yield to analyze the results of experiments you carry  out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the end of  this module you will have a better appreciation for stoichiometry. Whether you  are planning to launch a rocket into space and support humans during spaceflight,  or to experiment with a recipe when preparing food, a knowledge of  stoichiometry is essential.</p>
