<h4> Module Summary  and Assessment</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4> <img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Module Summary</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stoichiometry  is a method of predicting quantitative relationships within chemical systems.  Knowing the quantity of substances involved in a process is important when  planning or analyzing a process that will involve a chemical change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think back to the questions you were asked at  the beginning of the module:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How do scientists and engineers use mathematics when analyzing  chemical change?<br />
      <br />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How is a balanced chemical equation used to predict quantities of  species involved in a chemical process?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In this module you viewed a balanced chemical equation as a recipe for a  process, where coefficients of the species involved describe the amounts of  particles involved. You also used your knowledge of mathematical relationships  to calculate the quantity of matter participating in a process from measurable  data&mdash;including mass, concentration, volume, and pressure. Finally, you verified  the predictions made using the stoichiometric method by collecting and  analyzing evidence obtained through laboratory investigations. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The assessment  in this module consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Assignments for Lessons 1, 2, 3, and 4    </p>
  </li>
  </ul>
