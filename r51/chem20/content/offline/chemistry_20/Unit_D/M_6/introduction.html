<h4>Module Introduction</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During your  study in this course you have seen that chemical reactions are important to the  function of the human body, to interactions in the biosphere, and to many  technologies used today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this module  you will study chemical reactions from a different perspective by looking at  the quantities of each substance involved in the reaction. Investigating  quantitative relationships involves asking questions like</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How much will react? </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How much will be produced by the reaction?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How complete was the reaction?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Although  understanding the quantity of matter involved in a chemical process is one of  the more obvious aspects to consider when studying chemistry, you can only  begin to ask it now. This unit will test your ability to manage and manipulate  numerical data. You will also use numbers to help you keep track of the  quantities of matter you are investigating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think  about the following questions as you complete this module: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How do scientists and engineers use mathematics when analyzing  chemical change?<br />
      <br />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How is a balanced chemical equation used to predict quantities of  species involved in a chemical process?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
