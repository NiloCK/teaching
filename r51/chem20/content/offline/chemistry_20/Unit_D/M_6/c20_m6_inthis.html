<h4>In This Module</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson 1&mdash;Chemical Equations</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The focus of  this lesson is to review the main types of chemical reactions and how to write  balanced chemical equations. You will learn about what <em>balancing</em> means in terms of quantities of  substances involved in a chemical reaction. The concepts covered in this lesson  are critical to what you will learn in the remaining lessons.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What information about a chemical system is contained within a  balanced chemical equation?<br />
      <br />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What information about a chemical system is not contained within a  balanced chemical equation?<br />
      <br />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is conservation of mass, and how is it demonstrated in a  chemical equation?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 2&mdash;Gravimetric Stoichiometry</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stoichiometry  is a method to predict the quantity of each substance that will be involved in  a reaction. Are predictions made using this method verified by experimental  results? In this lesson you will practise your skills and analyze data  collected from an experiment. You will also discover how to evaluate a chemical  reaction using both the theoretical and actual yield of a precipitate produced.</p>
<ul>
  <li>How are predictions made about the masses of reactants and/or  products involved in chemical reactions?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>How can you test the predictions made using the stoichiometric  method?<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>What is percent yield and how can it be determined?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 3&mdash;Gas Stoichiometry</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson  you will explore stoichiometry of chemical systems that involve the reactions  of gases.</p>
<ul>
  <li>How is the stoichiometric method applied to reactions that involve  gases?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Lesson 4&mdash;Solution Stoichiometry</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do principles  of stoichiometry apply to aqueous solutions? Are predictions made using this  method verified by experimental results? In this lesson you will practise your  skills and analyze data collected from experiments.</p>
<ul>
  <li>    How is the stoichiometric method applied to reactions that involve  solutions?</li>
  </ul>
