<p>Testing any  predictions made using the stoichiometric method involves performing an  experiment and comparing the prediction with the measurable quantity (result)  obtained. In the following activities you will test the stoichiometric method  using gravimetric analysis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the pre-lab  component you will calculate the expected result for the experiment. Following  the pre-lab, you will use a virtual lab investigation to perform an experiment.  Part of your analysis of the investigation will require you to determine a  percentage difference between the predicted and observed mass of product. For  the purpose of this investigation and the equipment used, a percentage  difference of less than 5% would support the hypothesis that predictions made  using the stoichiometric method are supported by experimental evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-lab:  Decomposition of Malachite</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malachite is commonly used  in jewellery. Malachite can react when heated. In this investigation you will  heat malachite to test whether the predictions made using the stoichiometric  method are confirmed by experimental data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The correct chemical  formula for malachite is Cu(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span>CuCO<span class="subscript">3</span>(s), not what is  stated in your textbook on page 288. The reaction of malachite when exposed to  heat is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">Cu(OH)<span class="subscript">2</span>CuCO<span class="subscript">3</span>(s) &rarr; 2CuO(s) + CO<span class="subscript">2</span>(g) + H<span class="subscript">2</span>O(g)</p>

<p>Predict the mass of  copper(II) oxide that will remain if 2.00 g of malachite undergoes  decomposition when heated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Record and save your prediction.&nbsp; It will be required in your assignment.<br />
