<p>Not all  chemical reactions propel rockets into space. In most cases, energy needed to cook food comes  from a combustion reaction. A combustion reaction is just one type of chemical  reaction that you may recall from your previous science studies. What other  types of reactions can you recall?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The focus of this lesson is to review how to write balanced chemical  equations and to discover what <em>balancing</em> means in terms of the quantities of substances involved in a chemical process.  The concepts covered in this lesson are critical to what you will learn in the  remaining lessons of this module.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Essential Questions</h6>
<ul>
  <li>    What information about a chemical system is contained within a  balanced chemical equation?</li>
  </ul>
<ul>
  <li>    What information about a chemical system is not contained within a  balanced chemical equation?</li>
  </ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What is conservation of mass, and how is it demonstrated in a  chemical equation?</p>
    </li>
</ul>
