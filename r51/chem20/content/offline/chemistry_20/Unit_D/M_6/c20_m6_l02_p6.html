<h5><img src="../icons/summary.gif" width="36" height="31" align="bottom" /> Lesson Summary</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this lesson  you investigated the following questions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How are predictions made about the masses of reactants and/or  products involved in chemical reactions?<br />
      <br />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can you test the predictions made using the stoichiometric  method?<br />
      <br />
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is percent yield and how can it be determined?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The procedure  for calculating the masses of reactants or products in a chemical reaction is  called gravimetric stoichiometry. There are four steps in solving any  gravimetric stoichiometry problem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Write  a balanced chemical equation, and list the given information&mdash;the masses and  molar masses of the known and desired substances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Convert  the mass of the known substance into number of moles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Use  the mole ratio to convert the number of moles calculated in Step 2 into the  number of moles for the desired substance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Calculate  the mass of the desired substance using the number of moles calculated in Step  3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You discovered  that the stoichiometric method can be tested by comparing predicted values with  data collected through experimentation. You also calculated the percent  difference and found that percent difference is a useful way to determine the  validity of predictions made using the stoichiometric method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You also  calculated percent yield. Percent yield is the ratio of the   the actual experimental quantity of product obtained and the maximum possible  theoretical quantity of product (as determined by the stoichiometry method). In  Lesson 3 you will use percent yield to assess the results of an experiment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Lesson  Glossary</h5>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>gravimetric analysis:</strong>  the determination  of masses of substances</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>yield of a reaction:</strong> a measured quantity of product obtained by a  chemical reaction, often expressed as a percentage of maximum yield</p>
