The ability to  launch humans into space and then support them while they are there involves the coordination of many systems. It  might surprise you that circuit boards like the one pictured below are  involved in all systems of a spacecraft. Whether the system is designed to  control the flow of fuel into a rocket engine or to control the composition of  gases within the crew compartment of the spacecraft, electronic circuits are  involved.<br />

The manufacture  of a circuit board actually involves removing the copper metal from a plate.  Proper treatment and handling of the industrial waste from this process  attempts to reclaim the copper. The process involves knowledge of the  stoichiometry of aqueous solutions.<br />
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
In the previous lessons you learned to use stoichiometry to predict  quantitative changes of solid and gaseous substances. As you were shown in  Modules 4 and 5, many chemical processes occur in aqueous solutions. Knowledge  of stoichiometry involving solutions is essential in understanding many  industrial and environmental issues.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
In this lesson  you will use stoichiometry to predict the quantities of substances in chemical  reactions that involve solutions.
<p>
&nbsp;

<h6>Essential Questions </h6>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>
	<p>
	How is the stoichiometric       method applied to reactions that involve solutions?
