<p>
In Module 6 you  applied the stoichiometric method to examine a number of chemical systems,  including the chemical reaction involved in launching the Space Shuttle. You  learned that careful consideration of chemical quantities is essential to  ensuring the desired result for a chemical process. In Module 7 you learned how  important it is to consider appropriate chemical quantities in the designs of the  chemical systems within a spacecraft and  in other situations.

Regardless of  whether a substance was a solid, a gas, or dissolved within a solution,  predictions made using stoichiometry were confirmed by the experiments you  performed. You also learned that stoichiometric relationships can be shown in a  graph, such as a titration curve.

<p>
Knowledge of  the relationships that involve the quantities of substances involved in a  reaction, in addition to the ability to apply the stoichiometric method and  perform calculations, is an essential skill you will need in Chemistry 30.
