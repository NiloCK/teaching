*/

/* Question 1:

   Computer programs are made of functions. Sometimes a user
   calls a function, and sometimes functions call each other.

   To call a function in Javascript, use the function's name
   followed by parenthesis. Type callMeMaybe() into the white
   input bar on the lower right of the page and hit 'enter' to
   call this function and complete question one.

   (That input on the lower right is called a command line.)
*/
function callMeMaybe(){
    calledMe = true;
    updateGrades();
    return "This is crazy!";
}

/* A few things happened there. updateGrades() was called, and
   you've earned your first checkmark on the top right!

   Also, note that "This is crazy!" was printed to the console,
   and that this is what the function 'returned'. When you
   enter a command on the command line, the thing that gets
   returned from your command gets printed along with a '>>'.
*/

/* Question 2:

   callMeMaybe() is a function that called for no arguments.
   This means that you didn't have to pass anything into it -
   it just worked on its own. Some functions need an input,
   like the examples below. Try them in the console like this:

   twoTimes(4)
   halfOf(7)

   And so on. Try them with whatever inputs you like.

   twoMoreThan(x) and oneThirdOf(x) have not been completed.
   Write these functions and make a call to updateGrades()
   to see if they are correct!
*/
function twoTimes(x){
  print("Two times " + x + " is:");
  return 2 * x;
}
function halfOf(x){
  print("Half of " + x + " is");
  return x / 2;
}
function twoMoreThan(x){
  //YOUR CODE HERE
}
function oneThirdOf(x){
  //YOUR CODE HERE
}

/* The functions twoTimes(x) and halfOf(x) above each called
   the print() function - this can be handy when trying to
   figure out how some code is working. If your code is doing
   something unexpected, try using the print() function to
   find out where things get off track.

   Javascript uses +, -, *, and / to do addition, subtraction,
   multiplication, and division, respectively. You can do
   combined operations as well, such as x + y * 2. Javascript
   uses the same order of operations that you're familiar with
   from math class, including parenthesis. x + y * 2 will be
   different than (x + y) * 2.
*/

/* Question 3:

   Functions can take any number of arguments - they just
   need to be defined that way. The sum(a,b) function below
   is an example.

   Using the functions on the page as a reference, define a
   new function called 'average' which takes two arguments
   and returns their average. Remember that the average of
   two numbers is their sum divided by two.
*/
function sum(a, b){
  print("The sum of " + a + " and " + b + " is:");
  return a + b;
}
// YOUR CODE HERE

/* Question 4:

   Besides arithmetic, Javascript can also do comparisons
   between values. Try calling biggerThanTen() with different
   inputs. This is useful when a program needs to make
   decisions. Try running biggest() with some different inputs
   to get a feel for how the if/else and comparison syntax work.

   When you get the hang of it, complete the function tooSmall,
   which checks to see if the input 'a' is too small to be the
   square root of 'x'. EG, tooSmall(3,16) should return true because
   3 is smaller than the square root of 16. tooSmall(4,16) should
   return false, because 4 is not smaller than the square root of 16.
*/
function biggerThanTen(x){
  return x > 10;
}
function biggest(a, b){
  if (a > b){
    print(a + " is bigger than " + b);
  } else {
    print(b + " is bigger than " + a);
  }

  if ( a + b > 5 ){
    print(a + " + " + b + " is bigger than five!");
  }

  return "There is a bug in this function. Can you make it say something silly?";
}
function tooSmall(a, x){
    // YOUR CODE HERE
}

/* Question 5:

  Sometimes we want a function to repeat a series of steps
  many times. To do this, we use a loop structure. One type of
  loop structure is the while() loop, which repeats as long as
  the condition it is evaluating is true. Read countdown(x) and
  try to figure out what it does. Try calling it with some
  different inputs.

  
*/
function countdown(x){
  if (biggerThanTen(x)){
    return "That's too much! I won't count it!";
  }

  while (x >= 0){
    print("X is now " + x);
    x = x - 1;
  }
  return "After the loop is finished, x is " + x + ".";
}

/* Question 6:

   All of the functions we have used so far have worked
   with input values to produce the output directly, but
   sometimes it is useful to create variables to store
   extra information. This is done with the var keyword.

   Using the countdown() function as a guide, complete the
   sumFromOneTo(x) function so that it adds all the numbers
   from one to x. Eg, sumFromOneTo(4) should return 10,
   since 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
*/
function sumFromOneTo(x){
  if (biggerThanTen(x)){
    return "It's too much! I won't add it!";
  }
  var sum = 0;

  while(x > 0){
    // YOUR CODE HERE
  }

  return sum;
}
