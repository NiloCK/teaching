# ED-2711 Project 2

## Develop a plan for a project based learning activity

In order to do this project you will need to have a good understanding of the concept of project and problem based learning as outlined in class and in the reference material provided online. This is an individual project. Each student must submit their own original work. The objective of this project is for you to use the fundamentals of project and problem based learning as it applies to all curriculum.

### Task

1. Take a course from your first teachable area (not a Tech. Ed. course). Select a topic or group of outcomes from that course and develop a project for your class that uses technology as a tool to solve an authentic problem. The project must:
  * Present some sort of a problem for students to solve in a cooperative learning environment.
  * Require students to use a significant amount of higher order thinking.
  * Require students to develop some sort of problem solving process.
  * Provide a detailed evaluation scheme that is transparent to the student.
2. Provide a detailed description of how you would organize the class to complete this project. This must include details on time management and cooperative activities.
3. Provide a detailed description of what a student product would look like if you were to use the project in your class.
4. Develop this project in one document to submit to the instructor. Please use proper headings when you are writing the document.
5. Submit the document to me on or before July 10th, 2015.


When evaluating this project I will be considering the following:
- Is the project based on some sort of problem?
- Does the project require students to use a problem solving process?
- Is it realistic to think that this project can be completed as it is planned?
- Will the project intrinsically motivate students?
- Are students using higher order thinking skills in this project?
- Is there a clear and appropriate evaluation scheme?
